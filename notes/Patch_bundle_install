INSTALLATION:
1) Confirm current OSBackup and explorer:
     on ssmn00pk00144:
	ls -ltr /osbackups/ssmn00pk00058 - verify time stamp is less than 7 days old
          if the current backup is more than 7 days old:
            /usr/local/bin/backupos.sh
     from ssmn00pk00058:
	ls -ltr /home/uss/bin/explorer/servers/ssmn00pk00058 - verify time stamp is less than 7 days old
          if current explorer is more than 7 days old:
            /home/uss/bin/explorer/bin/run_explorer.ksh -i
2) Unpackage the patch bundle on ssmn00pk00058:
     on ssmn00pk00058:
	mount ssmn00pk00144:/jumpstart /mnt
	cp /mnt/patch_cluster/Feb_2010/10_Recommended.zip /patch
	cd /patch
	unzip 10_Recommended.zip
	rm 10_Recommended.zip     
3) Verify with the Backup team it is safe to shut down the server
4) Shutdown server to maintenance mode:
     From the console:
	log in as root
	init 0 - wait for "ok>" prompt
        boot -s - from "ok>" prompt
5) Remove IDR Patch:
     patchrm IDR142144-15
        reboot to single user mode if instructed to do so by the patch removal
6) Install Patch cluster:
     cd /patch/10_Recommended
     ./install_cluster --s10cluster
7) Review log files for failures, warnings, errors; compare system files for changes:
     ls -l /etc/mail/sendmail.* - look for sendmail.cf to see if the DS entry was changed
     ls -l /etc/mail/submit.* - look for submit.cf to see if the DS entry was changed
     ls -l /etc/init.d - look for scripts that may have been updated by the patching process
8) Reboot the server:
     reboot
9) After server comes back online, verify all file systems are online
     run:
	df -h - currently mounted file systems
	expl -df ssmn00pk00058 - file systems mounted during last explorer run
10) Contact Backup team to start Networker if it hasn't already started and to verify everything is ok.


BACKOUT:
1) Perform bare bones recovery - restore from OSBackups and tape using Explorer as a checklist and comparison
