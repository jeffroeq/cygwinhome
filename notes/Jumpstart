JUMPSTART:
Before taking the server down to the <ok>, verify all disks are labelled.

jumpstart.carlson.com - going away, php based site
ssmn00pk00071 - Jumpstart for Sol9
ssmn00pk00144 - Jumpstart for Sol10

vi /etc/ethers (<ok> banner, need ethernet from bu interface)
vi /etc/hosts - add IP for bu interface to correspond to Primary name
vi /etc/bootparams - make entry to correspond to the new server
cd /tftpboot - contains boot files for jumpstart
	ln -s inetboot.SUN4V.Solaris10_5-08 hex4buIP
	ln -s inetboot.SUN4v.Solaris10_5-08 hex4buIP.SUN4v
	(hex4buIP can be obtained by running /pbs/utils/get_hex bu.Ip.add.ress)
cd /jumpstart/Solaris10_5-08/config
	vi rules - add corresponding entries for new server
	./check - verifies the rules file is ok
	cd sysid
	cp -rp oldserverimage newserver
		ex. cp -rp ssmn00pk00275 ssmn00pk00276
			where ssmn00pk00275 is an alread built server and
			ssmn00pk00276 is your new server
	cd newserver
	vi sysidcfg
		edit network_interface entries to match your new server
	cd ../../build/10.*
		directory contains begin.sh and finish.sh, scripts that run at the beginning and end of jumpstart.

on newserver console
<ok> boot net1:speed=100,duplex=full -v - install 
	(there needs to be a space between the - and install)
	(booting off net1 because we are using the bu interface to jumpstart)

if boot fails after some disk partitioning, verify all disks are labelled, then start over.
