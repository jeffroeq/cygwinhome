# DESCRIPTION: fbdf was written to aid in diagnosing filesystem full situations.
#              fbdf will perform a bdf on host for filesystem.  Then list the 
#              largest files in the designated directory and its subdirectories.
#              The file list will be stored in /home/uss/tmp/filesize.list.
#
#              If filesystem is blank, a simple bdf will be run on the designated
#              host.
#
#              fbdf assumes the user has read/write access to /home/uss/tmp 
#              and permission to run bdf on host.
#              
# INPUTS: host - host to run on
#         filesystem - filesystem to run on
# OUTPUTS: creates the file /home/uss/tmp/filesize.list  This file is a sorted
#          (smallest to largest) of all files in directory and sub-dirs
