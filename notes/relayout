	vxassist -g diskgroup maxgrow volume - will show how large the volume can be grown to
		dbss0301:/ #vxassist -g cpssharesdg maxgrow reporting
		Volume reporting can be extended by 126781440 to: 760678400 (371425Mb)
Grow volume:	
	vxassist -g diskgroup growto volume disksize# - will grow the volume to the given size
	/usr/lib/fs/ufs/mkfs -F ufs -M /mount_point /dev/vx/rdks/diskgroup/volume disksize#
