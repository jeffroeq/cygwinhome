(Note that the maximum number of threads is the value supplied at runtime: nfsd –a <maxthreads> )


#It’s also good to take a look at an affected NFS client system:

#Clear the counters:
nfsstat -z

#And then capture values once every few minutes and note trends - DO THIS ON THE CLIENT SIDE ONLY
nfsstat -rc
