	EXAMPLE:
	OAAM14C> reset server 11

	WARNING: Resetting the server trips its E-Fuse. This causes all power to be momentarily removed from the server. This command should only be used when physical access to the server is unavailable, and the server must be removed and reinserted. 

	Any disk operations on direct attached storage devices will be affected. I/O
	will be interrupted on any direct attached I/O devices.

	Entering anything other than 'YES' will result in the command not executing.

	Do you want to continue ? YES

	Successfully reset the E-Fuse for device bay 11.
