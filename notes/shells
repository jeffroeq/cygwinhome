SHELLS AND THEIR INIT FILES

KSH-SOLARIS
Now executing /etc/profile
Executed at login time.
System wide profile.
Should include pathing and basic shell variable values.

The bare minimum path.

PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin/X11:/usr/ucb:/usr/local/java/java/bin
export PATH
MANPATH=/usr/man:/usr/local/man:/usr/share/man
export MANPATH


Executing ~/.profile
Executed at login time.
User defined pathing and variables.

If the user want to add local pathing, it should be something like the 
following:

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:.
export PATH

Note, this shell appears to only execute the start up files on login.
all sub-process shells inherit their path and environment from the 
parrent process. (from the /etc/profile and ~/.profile)

CSH-SOLARIS
Now executing /etc/.login
Executed at login time.
System wide profile.
Should include pathing and basic shell variable values.

The bare minimum path.

set path=(/usr/local/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/local/bin/X11 /usr/ucb /usr/local/java/java/bin)
set manpath=(/usr/man /usr/local/man)


Now executing ~/.cshrc
Executed at login time and when ever a shell is started up or spauned.
User defined pathing and variables.

If the user want to add local pathing, it should be something like the 
following:

set path=($path $HOME/bin .)


Now executing ~/.login
Executed at login time.
Users should add any environment variables or recodes the want to exist in their
interactive environment in this file.

an example of one would be as follows:
setenv EDITOR emacs

System wide file.

/etc/.login.

When the shell executes a shell script that attempts to exe-
cute a non-existent command interpreter, the shell returns
an erroneous diagnostic message that the shell script file
does not exist.

~/.cshrc Read at beginning of execution by each
shell.
~/.login Read by login shells after .cshrc at
login.
~/.logout Read by login shells at logout.
~/.history Saved history for use at next login.

SHELL=/bin/tcsh - ZIPPY.CS.SONOMA.EDU

/etc/csh.cshrc Read first by every shell. ConvexOS, Stel-
lix and Intel use /etc/cshrc and NeXTs use
/etc/cshrc.std. A/UX, AMIX, Cray and IRIX
have no equivalent in csh(1), but read this
file in tcsh anyway. Solaris 2.x does not
have it either, but tcsh reads /etc/.cshrc.
(+)

/etc/csh.login Read by login shells after /etc/csh.cshrc.
ConvexOS, Stellix and Intel use /etc/login,
NeXTs use /etc/login.std, Solaris 2.x uses
/etc/.login and A/UX, AMIX, Cray and IRIX
use /etc/cshrc.

~/.tcshrc (+) Read by every shell after /etc/csh.cshrc or
its equivalent.

~/.cshrc Read by every shell, if ~/.tcshrc doesn't
exist, after /etc/csh.cshrc or its
equivalent. This manual uses `~/.tcshrc' to
mean `~/.tcshrc or, if ~/.tcshrc is not
found, ~/.cshrc'.

~/.login Read by login shells after ~/.tcshrc or
~/.history. The shell may be compiled to
read ~/.login before instead of after
~/.tcshrc and ~/.history; see the version
shell variable.

~/.cshdirs (+) Read by login shells after ~/.login if
savedirs is set, but see also dirsfile.

/etc/csh.logout Read by login shells at logout. ConvexOS,
Stellix and Intel use /etc/logout and NeXTs
use /etc/logout.std. A/UX, AMIX, Cray and
IRIX have no equivalent in csh(1), but read
this file in tcsh anyway. Solaris 2.x does
not have it either, but tcsh reads
/etc/.cshrc. (+)

~/.logout Read by login shells at logout after
/etc/csh.logout or its equivalent.
