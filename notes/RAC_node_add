new node requires a total of 5 IP's.
1 SDS - needs to be plumbed up to the same interface name as the other nodes. ie. ce2, ce3, etc...
1 SME
1 VIP must be the same vlan as the SDS.
2 Interconnects on the same vlan as the existing nodes interconnects
2 fiber connections to SAN - New node needs to be zoned to the existing LUNs on the existing nodes

OS Level:
OS needs to be the same kernel/patch level on the new node as the existing nodes

Add users:
oracle userid needs to be added to the new node
oinstall group needs to be added to the new node

Mount Points:
Create directory structure for all shared mounts on the new node

/etc/vfstab:
One node should be the primary backup node.  Setup vfstab on the backup node to include any VCS
   mounted filesystems.  Mount at boot is set to no, no device is listed for fsck, and no options are given.
   This /etc/vfstab entry should exist on all 3 nodes, but they should be uncommented only on the backup node.
	example:
	###################################BACKUPS#######################################
	## The following 3 b_0# entries are for backup purposes only, and they do not  ##
	## need to be mounted by the OS.  They are needed for legato to be able to     ##
	## back them up.  Legato is only backing these filesystems from ssmn00pk00286. ##
	## If ssmn00dk00286 has issues, migrate these entries and the fiber to tape    ##
	## connection to another node in this RAC cluster.                             ##
	###################################BACKUPS#######################################
	#/dev/vx/dsk/pcdb01_rac/b_01       -       /cwtdb/pcdb01_rac/b_01      vxfs    -       no      -
	#/dev/vx/dsk/tst1db_rac/b_01       -       /cwtdb/tst1db_rac/b_01      vxfs    -       no      -
	#/dev/vx/dsk/tst2db_rac/b_01       -       /cwtdb/tst2db_rac/b_01      vxfs    -       no      -

/etc/system:
copy /etc/system kernel entries for oracle to new node from existing node.
	For example, the following would be added to a Oracle 10g node /etc/system:
	set sd:sd_max_throttle=256
	set sd:sd_io_time=120

	set shmsys:shminfo_shmmax=9663676416
	set shmsys:shminfo_shmmin=1
	set shmsys:shminfo_shmmni=1024
	set shmsys:shminfo_shmseg=54
	set semsys:seminfo_semmns=3072
	set semsys:seminfo_semmni=160
	set semsys:seminfo_semmap=50
	set semsys:seminfo_semmnu=170


INSTALL STORAGE FOUNDATION FOR RAC:
on new node:
mount ssmn00pk00144:/downloads /mnt
execute:
/mnt/SymantecStorageFoundation/install/storage_foundation_for_oracle_rac/installsfrac -installonly
	When it prompts for a license, grab the license for VERITAS Storage Foundation for Oracle RAC on 
	   the master node of the existing cluster using the "vxlicrep -s" command.

execute:
vxinstall
	answer n for any license questions
	answer n for enclosure-based naming
	answer n for systemwide disk group or the system
vxdisk -o alldgs list - to confirm the existing disks are available to the new node.
	if the disks from the other server do not appear, contact the storage team

Install Veritas MP1:
execute:
/mnt/SymantecStorageFoundation/installMP/installmp
reboot

ADD NEW NODE TO CLUSTER:
on ssmn00dk00238 and ssmn00dk00239:
  vi /etc/llthosts to include:
	2 ssmn00dk00286
  scp /etc/llthosts ssmn00dk00286:/etc

on ssmn00dk00286:
  vi /etc/llttab
	set-node ssmn00dk00286
	set-cluster 102
	link ce0 /dev/ce:0 - ether - -
	link ce1 /dev/ce:1 - ether - -
  vi /etc/gabtab
	/sbin/gabconfig -c -n3

on ssmn00dk00238 and ssmn00dk00239:
  vi /etc/gabtab
	/sbin/gabconfig -c -n3

on ssmn00dk00286:
  scp ssmn00dk00239:/etc/vcsmmtab /etc
  scp ssmn00dk00239:/etc/vxfendg /etc
  
  start llt and gab:
	/etc/init.d/llt start
	/etc/init.d/gab start

  scp ssmn00dk00239:/etc/vxfenmode /etc
  /etc/init.d/vxfen start
  /etc/init.d/vcsmm start
  /etc/init.d/lmx start
 
  /etc/init.d/odm start

  Verify GAB port memberships a,b,d,o
	gabconfig -a


on ssmn00dk00239:
  cpv /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/main.cf
  haconf -makerw
  hasys -add ssmn00dk00286
  hagrp -modify cvm SystemList -add ssmn00dk00286 2
  hagrp -modify cvm AutoStartList -add ssmn00dk00286
  hagrp -modify ora_priv Address -add 10.176.248.3 -sys ssmn00dk00286
  hagrp -modify ora_priv Device -add ce4 0 -sys ssmn00dk00286
  hagrp -modify ora_priv Device -add ce5 1 -sys ssmn00dk00286
  hacf -verify /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/main.cf

  hastop -all -force

  scp /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/main.cf ssmn00dk00238:/etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config
  scp /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/main.cf ssmn00dk00286:/etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config

On both existing servers starting with master:
  hastart
  hastatus -sum - verify the resource has come online
  
  #enable the cluster to recognize the new node
  /etc/vx/bin/vxclustadm -m vcs -t gab reinit
  /etc/vx/bin/vxcluxtadm nidmap

on ssmn00dk00286
  cat /etc/llthost - determine node ID
  gabconfig -a - verify the node ID is seen by GAB
    If ports f,u,v, or w are present in from the gabconfig command, reboot 286
    otherwise:
         hastart
  hastatus -sum - to confirm cluster status
  
########################### ROOT.SH NOTES #############################
## Running Oracle root.sh, rootaddnode.sh, etc...                    ##
## (commands will be provided by Oracle DBA at the correct time).    ##
## look at these notes before running the scripts for the Oracle DBA ##
#######################################################################

Turn off the banner setting in sshd.
  vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config  - comment out the banner line.
  /etc/init.d/sshd restart

The umask for root needs to be set to 0022 to make sure all files created from 
  the scripts have the correct permissions.
    vi /etc/custom_profile - update the umask line to 022 if it's not already.

vote.loc files need to have permission of 660.  Verify location of these files with the DBA

CRS_HOME (ie. /u01/crs/oracle/product/1020/crs) and ORACLE_HOME (/u01/app/oracle) 
  need to have permissions set to 775.  This will disable ssh keys.  
	To work around this issue, in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, change SrtictModes from "Yes" to "No" 
	  and restart sshd.
  These settings can be set back to the original configuration after install is complete.

If running oracle 10.2.0.3 or later:
  you may need to touch CRS_HOME/log/$HOSTNAME/cssd/$HOSTNAME.pid before the cssd-monitor script 
    reports CRS is running.

If running Oracle 10G:
  cd /opt/VRTSvcs/rac/lib
    If the version of Oracle 10g is 32-bit, enter:
      cp libskgxn2_32.so /opt/ORCLcluster/lib/libskgxn2.so
    If the version of Oracle 10g is 64-bit, enter:
      cp libskgxn2_64.so /opt/ORCLcluster/lib/libskgxn2.so

If the servers are running Openssh:
  Move the existing /usr/local/bin/ssh and scp and link from /usr/bin/ssh and scp:
    cd /usr/local/bin
    mv ssh ssh.orig
    ln -s /usr/bin/ssh ssh
    mv scp scp.orig
    ln -s /usr/bin/scp scp
