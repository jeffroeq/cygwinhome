1) Confirm OSBackups and Explorer are current
    from ssmn00pk00144:
      ls -ltr /osbackups/ssmn00dk00230 - verify time stamp is less than a week old
        if the files are older than a week:
          /usr/local/bin/backos.sh
    from ssmn00dk00230:
      ls -ltr /home/uss/bin/explorer/servers/ssmn00dk00230 - verify time stamp is less than a week old
        if the files are older than a week:
          /home/uss/bin/explorer/bin/run_explorer.ksh -i
2) Gather OBP NVRAM settings:
     eeprom nvramrc >> /home/uss/ujmj003/nvram.out
3) Unzip patch and copy to / directory
     cp /home/uss/ujmj003/140685-02.zip /var/tmp
     unzip /var/tmp/140685-02.zip
     cp /var/tmp/140685-02/flash-update* /
     chmod 755 /flash-update*
4) Verify it is safe to shut the server down
5) Shut server down to "ok>" prompt:
     shutdown -g 60 -y -i 0 "Server is shutting down in 60 seconds.  Please save your work and log off.  Thanks --Jeff Johnson CRC-C-UNIX"
6) from the "ok"> prompt:
     setenve auto-boot? false
     boot disk /flash-update-SunFire245
       When prompted - enter "sa" to select all available firmware releases; then "cont" to continue the install; Enter to continue
7) Return to the "ok>" prompt:
     you should automatically be returned to the "ok>" prompt, if not, perform a "STOP B" to halt the boot and return to the OBP
8) Verify the successful flash update of the firmware:
     .version
       should display:
         OBP 4.30.4, POST 4.30.4, OBDIAG 4.30.4
9) Reboot server:
     setenv auto-boot? true
     boot

2) Gather OBP NVRAM settings:
     eeprom nvramrc >> /home/uss/ujmj003/nvram.out
3) Verify it is safe to shutdown the server - application should be offline
4) Unzip patch and copy to / directory
     cp /home/uss/ujmj003/140685-02.zip /var/tmp
     unzip /var/tmp/140685-02.zip
     /var/tmp/140685-02/unix.flash-update.SunFire245.sh
         - server will reboot automatically after firmware install is completed
5) After server is back online:
     prtconv -V
       should display:
         OBP 4.30.4, POST 4.30.4, OBDIAG 4.30.4
6) Verify NVRAMRC:
     eeprom nvramrc >> /tmp/nvram.post
     cat -vet /var/tmp/nvram.out
     cat -vet /tmp/nvram.post
       compare files if the current nvramrc is different, repair it to look like the old.
         eeprom nvramrc="devalias rootdisk /pci@1e,600000/pci@0/pci@a/pci@0/pci@8/scsi@1/disk@0,0 devalias rootmirr /pci@1e,600000/pci@0/pci@a/pci@0/pci@8/scsi@1/disk@1,0
