VIO UserID=padmin Passwd=uhgadm

Provision disk to LPAR from VIO (EMC Disk only):

from LPAR:
 #lsvg -o | lsvg -i = find how much disk is available from FREE PP's
 #lspv - find what type of SAN is used, HdiskPower = EMC, HDL=Hitachi

on VIO:
 $set -o vi = sets vi as current editor
 $lsvg -o | lsvg -i = find how much disk is available from FREE PP's; if not enough is available, submit request to storage team for more SAN
 $lspv = find what type of SAN is used, HdiskPower = EMC, HDL=Hitachi
 $lspv | grep hdiskpower = note hdiskpower disks available
 $lsmap -all | grep hdiskpower | wc -l = shows how many EMC disks are assigned to VIOs
 $cfgdev = run from all VIOs if new disks have been added and do not appear
 $lspv | grep hdiskpower = check to see if new disks appear, if not run "powermt config"
 $oem_setup_env = leaves restricted shell of VIO to normal UNIX shell
 #set -o vi = sets vi as current editor
 #powermt config = run only if disks do not appear after cfgdev

find EMC disks not assigned, run from both VIOs to make sure they match:
 #lsmap -all | grep hdiskpower | wc -l
 362
 #lsmap -all | grep hdiskpower31
 hdiskpower31
 hdiskpower311
 hdiskpower312
 hdiskpower313
 hdiskpower314
 hdiskpower315
 hdiskpower316
 #lsmap -all | grep hdiskpower32
 #lsmap -all | grep hdiskpower30
 hdiskpower30
 hdiskpower300
 hdiskpower301
 hdiskpower302
 hdiskpower303
 hdiskpower304
 hdiskpower305
 hdiskpower306
 hdiskpower307
 hdiskpower308
 hdiskpower309
 #
From this there are 362 disks allocated to these VIOs and hdiskpower317 is the first not used

If disks do not appear after cfgdev:
 #powermt config

Run to see if pvid is set:
 #lspv | grep hdiskpower317
 hdiskpower317	00cffb1eccec64e7	None
00cffb1eccec64e7 is the pvid
If pvid is not set:
 #chdev -l hdiskpower317 -a pv=yes = sets pvid
 #powermt config = from 2nd VIO, pvid should now exist and match pvid from 1st VIO

set MPIO reserve lock flag, opens disk for use, on all disks to be added to LPAR, from both VIO's:
 #chdev -l hdiskpower317 -a reserve_lock=no
 #lsattr -El hdiskpower317 = shows attributes of disk

from LPAR:
 #lsattr -El sys0 | grep Partition
 "id_to_partition 0x800018B54A20000C Partition ID" = last 2 characters are parition ID, "0c" is parition ID

from VIO:
 #exit = return to restricted shell of VIO
 $lsmap -all | grep vhost | grep 0c = 0c is the partition ID found in prior step
 vhost7          U9117.570.10FFB1E-V2-C37                     0x0000000c
 vhost17         U9117.570.10FFB1E-V2-C67                     0x0000000c
vhost17 is the vhost adapter for the non-rootvg disk
 $lsmap -vadapater vhost17 = lists all disks attached to the vhost adapter, disks should indicate attachment to LPAR in question

from LPAR:
 #lspv = lists used hdisk names, ie hdisk1 - hdisk23; hdisk24 would be first new disk

from VIO:
 #mkdev -vdev hdiskpower317 -vadapter vhost17 -dev hostnameemc24 = run from both VIO's for each disk to attach to LPAR

from LPAR:
 #cfgmgr = adds new disks
 #lspv = shows new disks
 #lspath = verify each new disk is listed twice, 2 vscis's
 #chdev -l hdisk24 -a hcheck_interval=60 = add health check interval of 60 sec for each disk added
 #extendvg emcvg hdisk24 hdisk25 hdisk26 = adds hdisk24, hdisk25, and hdisk26 to VG
