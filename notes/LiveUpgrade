#Check current OS Version:
   cat /etc/release - needs to be at least 10_0910 Solaris10_u9 for this to work properly.

#check current boot environments:

#create new alternate boot environment(abe):
   lucreate -n abe_name

#delete alternate boot environment:
   ludetele abe_name

#patch alternate boot environment:
   luupgrade -t -n 10_1009_date -s /patches/10_Recommended/patches
   After 1 or 2 weeks of testing, come back and delete the old boot environment:
     ludelete 10_1009

**********************************************************************

The target boot environment has been activated. It will be used when you 
reboot. NOTE: You MUST NOT USE the reboot, halt, or uadmin commands. You 
MUST USE either the init or the shutdown command when you reboot. If you 
do not use either init or shutdown, the system will not boot using the 
target BE.

**********************************************************************

In case of a failure while booting to the target BE, the following process 
needs to be followed to fallback to the currently working boot environment:

1. Enter the PROM monitor (ok prompt).

2. Boot the machine to Single User mode using a different boot device 
(like the Solaris Install CD or Network). Examples:

     At the PROM monitor (ok prompt):
     For boot to Solaris CD:  boot cdrom -s
     For boot to network:     boot net -s

3. Mount the Current boot environment root slice to some directory (like 
/mnt). You can use the following commands in sequence to mount the BE:

     zpool import rpool
     zfs inherit -r mountpoint rpool/ROOT/10_1009
     zfs set mountpoint=<mountpointName> rpool/ROOT/10_1009 
     zfs mount rpool/ROOT/10_1009

4. Run <luactivate> utility with out any arguments from the Parent boot 
environment root slice, as shown below:

     <mountpointName>/sbin/luactivate

5. luactivate, activates the previous working boot environment and 
indicates the result.

6. Exit Single User mode and reboot the machine.
