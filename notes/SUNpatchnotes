# create links in the patch bundle so the new builds use them:
    # cd 10_Recommended
    # for patches in `cat patch_order`
    # do
    # ln -s patches/$patches .
    # done


# Download latest patch bundle:
   Open case with Terix for new patch bundles for Solaris 9 and 10
   Terix will provide download instructions


# Patch testing and preparation: 
   if ./installcluster comes back with usage statement, try "./installcluster --s10cluster" instead
   Prepare patch cluster for FIOps:
   Build Sol9 and Sol10 lab servers and install the patch bundles and updated packages to verify they work
   Edit the installcluster script and repackage bundle:
      find the "passcode_confirmed=" entry and change it to "passcode_confirmed=true" - this will allow the patch bundle to install 
	  without adding the passcode
      find "# set low water mark on free space in accordance with DAP patching requirements:
	change the minimum size requirements so it doesn't require 2gb of space in /var
	  change req_kb_var_run=$(( 10000 + max_patch_size_kb + 2 * contents_size_kb ))
		to
	  req_kb_var_run=200000

# Check current version of utilities against what's installed:
   for PKG in `pkginfo -l | grep SMC | awk '{print $2}'`
   do
     print -n ${PKG} "   ";pkginfo -l ${PKG} | grep VERSION | awk '{print $2}'

   if any packages do not match what is currently in the patch level document download from jumpstart server:
      ssh ux255
      cd /jumpstart/pkgs/custom/sparc
      scp -pr SMCpkg server:/patches

# Check current version of PowerPath
   pkginfo -l EMCpower | grep VERSION
   if the Version does not match what is currently indicated in the patch level document, download from jumpstart server:
      ssh ux255
      cd /jumpstart/Software/SAN/powerpath
      scp EMCPower*.tar server:/patches
      on server:
	 cd /patches
	 tar -xvf EMCPower*.tar	
	 pkgrm EMCpower
	 pkgadd -d . EMCpower
	 pkginfo -l EMCpower | grep VERSION - verify the VERSION matches the patch level document

# /opt/jet/Clients/common.files/install_stb.sh - updates Explorer and sneep


# Updating utilities
download new tools from sunfreeware to a common location:
   Download Solaris 8 packages for every package except lsof.  Because of icompatibility lsof requires a separate package for each
     version of Solaris, so downdload lsof for Sol8, Sol9, and Sol10.
   ux255:/jumpstart/pkgs/pkg_updates

convert to standard Sun packages (use pkgtrans):
   cd /jumpstart/pkgs/pkg_updates
   for PKG in `ls -1 | awk -F"." '{print $1}'``
   do
     gunzip ${PKG}.gz
     pkgtrans ./${PKG} .
     rm ${PKG}
   done

tar updates for ease of transfers:
   cd /jumpstart/pkgs
   tar -cvf /jumpstart/pkgs/pkg_updates.tar.date updates

scp to server to be patches:
   scp /jumsptart/pkgs/pkg_updates.tar.date server:/patches

untar pkg_updates.tar.date:
   cd /patches
   tar -xvf pkg_updates.tar.date

boot into single user:
   init 0
   boot -s

upgrade packages:
   cd /patches/pkg_updates
   for PKG in `ls -1`
   do
     pkgrm ${PKG} - reply "y" to every question
     pkgadd -d . ${PKG} - reply "y" to every question
   done

verify upgrade packages are installed:
   for PKG in `ls -1`
   do
     echo ${PKG}
     pkginfo -l ${PKG} | grep VERSION
   done

run cfagent to make sure any custom files are up to date:
   cfagent -qv

after testing has been satisfied with the new packages, add them to the standard build image:
   cp /jumpstart/pkgs/pkg_updates/SMC* /jumpstart/pkgs/custom/sparc
