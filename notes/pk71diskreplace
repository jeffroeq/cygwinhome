1) Verify osbackup and explorer are current, if not execute one:
    on ssmn00pk00144:
      ls -ltr /osbackups/ssmn00pk00071
      if it doesn't exist:
       /usr/local/bin/backupos.sh
    from ssmn00pk00071:
      ls -ltr /home/uss/bin/explorer/servers/ssmn00pk00071
      if it doesn't exist:
        /home/uss/bin/explorer/bin/run_explorer.ksh -i
2) Move dumpdevice to good disk:
    dumpadm -d /dev/dsk/c1t1d0s1
3) Verify which is the disk to repalce:
    for each internal disk, c1t1d0, c1t2d0, c1t3d0, c1t4d0, and c1t5d0 run the following
      format c1t1d0 -> analyze -> read -> yes
        look at the server to see which disk is lighting up.
        By running this on each of the internal disks you can verify which is your bad one.
3) Offline the disk in Veritas:
    vxdisk offline c1t0d0s2 
4) Verify disk is marked as offline:
    vxdisk list | grep c1t0d0
5) Attempt to tell the OS to remove the disk:
    luxadm remove_device /dev/rdsk/c1t0d0s2
    if this does not work:
      vxdisk rm c1t0d0s2
      luxadm -e offline /dev/rdsk/c1t0d0s2
6) Clean up device tree:
    devfsadm -Cv -c disk
7) Verify disk has been removed:
    vxdisk list - if the disk is still listed run: vxdisk rm c1t0d0s2
    echo |format | more
8) Physically replace the disk
9) Pull the disk under OS control:
    devfsadm -v
10) format and label the disk:
     format c1t0d0 -> label -> yes
     prtvtoc /dev/rdsk/c1t1d0s2 | fmthard -s - /dev/rdsk/c1t0d0s2
11) configure the disk for use in veritas:
     vxdctl enable
     /etc/vx/bin/vxdisksetup -i c1t0d0
12) replace failed disk in Veritas
     vxdiskadm -> option 5 -> select failed disk -> select replacement disk -> yes
