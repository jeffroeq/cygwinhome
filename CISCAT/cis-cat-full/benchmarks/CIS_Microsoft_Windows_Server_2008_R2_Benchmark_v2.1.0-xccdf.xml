   <notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en"> BACKGROUND. The Center for Internet Security ("CIS")
      provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other
      services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to
      Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result
      from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally
      generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to
      organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and
      devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to
      specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick
      fix" for anyone's information security needs. NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
      CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or
      negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any
      particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of
      any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of the
      Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is"
      and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind. USER
      AGREEMENTS. By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We")
      agree and acknowledge that: 1. No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component
      can be made fully secure; 2. We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our
      own risk; 3. We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of
      the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from CIS's negligence or failure
      to perform; 4. We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the
      Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the Recommendations to our
      particular circumstances and requirements; 5. Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below)
      has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify
      us of the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and 6. Neither CIS
      nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract,
      tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or
      special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or
      damage to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of
      privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted
      management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties)
      arising out of or in any way Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the
      Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages),
      including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual
      property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other
      harmful items. GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS. CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but
      only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use: 1.
      Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written
      agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and use each of the Products on a single
      computer; 2. Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a
      Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are
      printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed
      Terms of Use in its entirety. RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON
      DISTRIBUTION. The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and
      by international treaties. We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any
      intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to
      the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS reserves all rights
      not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
      Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some
      classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have
      otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile,
      disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software
      Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute,
      encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any
      Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on
      any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device,
      without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or
      alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in
      any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter
      these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi)
      use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a
      Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product
      with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such
      Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a
      particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product. We will
      not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed
      in this paragraph. We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers,
      directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates,
      licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all
      other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or
      Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses,
      costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS
      Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding
      paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive
      defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree
      to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim. We further agree that all CIS Parties are
      third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. SPECIAL RULES. CIS
      has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other
      persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship. Those special
      rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are
      covered by the special rules. CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software
      Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains
      in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the
      right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization,
      whether by manual or electronic means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the
      foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and
      may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION;
      VENUE. We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and
      construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in
      equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the
      courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any of these
      Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable,
      then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
      of any remaining provisions. BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE
      AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN
      ALL RESPECTS.</notice>

                  <description xml:lang="en">The Message Queuing Down Level Clients service provides
                     Active Directory access for Windows NT 4.0, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows
                     Millennium Edition, and Windows 2000 clients that use the Message Queuing
                     service on domain controllers. The Message Queuing service optionally uses
                     information that is published in Active Directory to obtain routing information
                     for security-related objects, such as destination public keys, and to learn
                     about public queues. If you install Message Queuing in workgroup mode, Active
                     Directory is never accessed. This service is only required on Windows Server
                     domain controllers that run the Message Queuing service.</description>
                  <rationale xml:lang="en">Any service or application is a potential point of
                     attack. Therefore, you should disable or remove any unneeded services or
                     executable files in your environment. There are additional optional services
                     available in Windows that are not installed during a default installation of
                     the operating system. Depending on the version of Windows you can add these
                     optional services to an existing computer through Add/Remove Programs in
                     Control Panel, Programs and Features in Control Panel, Server Manager, or the
                     Configure Your Server Wizard. Important: If you enable additional services,

                     for multiple user processes to share TCP ports over the net.tcp protocol. This
                     service supports the .NET Framework 3.0 Windows Communication Foundation (WCF),
                     which provides a new TCP-based network protocol (net.tcp://) for
                     high-performance communication. This service allows a net.tcp port to be shared
                     and secured in a similar fashion as port 80 is for HTTP traffic.</description>

                     ticket to another computer, it must request a TGT from the authentication
                     service in its account domain. The authentication service returns a TGT for the
                     ticket-granting service in the target computer's domain. The TGT can be reused

                  <description xml:lang="en">Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service implements
                     the WS-Management protocol for remote management. WS-Management is a standard
                     web services protocol used for remote software and hardware management. The
                     WinRM service listens on the network for WS-Management requests and processes
                     them. The WinRM Service needs to be configured with a listener using winrm.cmd
                     command line tool or through Group Policy in order for it to listen over the
                     network. The WinRM service provides access to WMI data and enables event
                     collection. Event collection and subscription to events require that the
                     service is running. WinRM messages use HTTP and HTTPS as transports. The WinRM
                     service does not depend on IIS but is preconfigured to share a port with IIS on
                     the same machine. The WinRM service reserves the /wsman URL prefix. To prevent
                     conflicts with IIS, administrators should ensure that any websites hosted on
                     IIS do not use the /wsman URL prefix.</description>

                        SCE. You can configure a computer so that it does not send announcements to
                        browsers on the domain. If you do so, you hide the computer from the Browse
                        list, which means that the computer will stop announcing itself to other
                        computers on the same network. An attacker who knows the name of a computer

                        identify and locate potential targets. For this reason, Microsoft recommends

                        configure it to Not Defined in enterprise environments. For additional

                        for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password

                        Electronic Engineers (IEEE) standard that defines a set of operating system
                        services. The POSIX subsystem is required if the server supports
                        applications that use that subsystem. The POSIX subsystem introduces a
                        security risk that relates to processes that can potentially persist across
                        logons. If a user starts a process and then logs out, there is a potential
                        that the next user who logs on to the computer could access the previous
                        user's process. This potential is dangerous, because anything the second
                        user does with that process will be performed with the privileges of the

                        client/server software that allows users to link personal computers together
                        on a single network. Network capabilities include transparent file and print
                        sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active
                        Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication
                        protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some
                        reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager
                        authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants,
                        and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when
                        they perform the following operations: . Join a domain . Authenticate
                        between Active Directory forests . Authenticate to down-level domains .
                        Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,
                        or Windows XP) . Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The
                        possible values for the Network security: LAN Manager authentication level
                        setting are: . Send LM &amp; NTLM responses . Send LM &amp; NTLM — use
                        NTLMv2 session security if negotiated . Send NTLM responses only . Send
                        NTLMv2 responses only . Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM . Send NTLMv2

                        Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response
                        authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the
                        authentication protocol level that clients use, the session security level
                        that the computers negotiate, and the authentication level that servers
                        accept as follows: . Send LM &amp; NTLM responses. Clients use LM and NTLM
                        authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers
                        accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send LM &amp; NTLM use NTLMv2
                        session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and
                        use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers
                        accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLM response only.
                        Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the
                        server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2

                        server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2
                        authentication. . Level 2 Send NTLM response only. Clients use only NTLM
                        authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it.
                        Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 3
                        Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, and use NTLMv2
                        session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM,
                        NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 4 Domain controllers refuse LM
                        responses. Clients use NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security
                        if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM authentication, that
                        is, they accept NTLM and NTLMv2. . Level 5 Domain controllers refuse LM and
                        NTLM responses (accept only NTLMv2). Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, use
                        and NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers

                     <rationale xml:lang="en">In Windows Vista, this setting is undefined. However,
                        in Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP clients are configured
                        by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based
                        and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default setting on servers
                        allows all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources.
                        However, this means that LM responses—the weakest form of authentication
                        response—are sent over the network, and it is potentially possible for
                        attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's
                        password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems
                        cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this
                        reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by
                        default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You
                        can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows
                        98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a
                        secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2
                        for earlier clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are
                        members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to
                        authenticate with Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.</rationale>

                        the SCE. NetBIOS over TCP/IP is a network protocol that among other things
                        provides a way to easily resolve NetBIOS names that are registered on
                        Windowsbased systems to the IP addresses that are configured on those
                        systems. This setting determines whether the computer releases its NetBIOS
                        name when it receives a name-release request.</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">The NetBT protocol is designed not to use
                        authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to spoofing. Spoofing makes a
                        transmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed
                        the action. A malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated nature of the
                        protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which would
                        cause the computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries. The
                        result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues
                        on the target computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood,
                        domain logons, the NET SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution.

                        extension to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll. In previous
                        versions of Windows, Negotiate decides whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for
                        authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts, which is treated
                        as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including
                        PKU2U. You can also develop or add other SSPs. When computers are configured
                        to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, Negoexts.dll calls
                        the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains
                        a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers.
                        When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is
                        sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate
                        to a security token and the logon process completes. This policy will be
                        turned off by default on domain joined machines. This would disallow the
                        online identities to be able to authenticate to the domain joined machine in
                        Windows 7.</description>

                        introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious
                        software running under elevated credentials without the user or
                        administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these
                        programs was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator"
                        because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To
                        address this risk, in Windows Vista the built-in Administrator account is
                        disabled. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with
                        administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two
                        ways: . If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account
                        you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator. . If the
                        computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created.
                        The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and
                        create one if a local administrator account is warranted. Once Windows Vista
                        is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be enabled, but we
                        strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.</rationale>

                        insensitivity is enforced for all subsystems. The Microsoft Win32® subsystem
                        is case insensitive. However, the kernel supports case sensitivity for other
                        subsystems, such as the Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX
                        (POSIX). Because Windows is case insensitive (but the POSIX subsystem will
                        support case sensitivity), failure to enforce this policy setting makes it
                        possible for a user of the POSIX subsystem to create a file with the same
                        name as another file by using mixed case to label it. Such a situation can
                        block access to these files by another user who uses typical Win32 tools,
                        because only one of the files will be available.</description>

                        descriptor field is populated with the Security Descriptor Definition
                        Language representation of those groups and privileges. If the security
                        descriptor is left blank, the policy setting is defined in the template, but
                        it is not enforced. Users and groups can be given explicit Allow or Deny
                        privileges on both local access and remote access. The registry settings
                        that are created as a result of enabling the DCOM: Machine Access

                        settings in this area. RpcSs checks the new registry keys in the Policies
                        section for the computer restrictions, and these registry entries take
                        precedence over the existing registry keys under OLE. This means that
                        previously existing registry settings are no longer effective, and if you
                        make changes to the existing settings, the computer access permissions for
                        any users are not changed. You should take care to correctly configure their
                        list of users and groups. The possible values for this policy setting are:
                        Blank. This represents the local security policy way of deleting the policy
                        enforcement key. This value deletes the policy and then sets it as Not
                        defined state. The Blank value is set by using the ACL editor and emptying
                        the list, and then pressing OK. SDDL. This is the Security Descriptor
                        Definition Language representation of the groups and privileges you specify
                        when you enable this policy. Not Defined. This is the default value. Note If
                        the administrator is denied permission to access DCOM applications due to
                        the changes made to DCOM in SP2, the administrator can use the DCOM: Machine

                        policy setting to manage DCOM access to the computer. The administrator can
                        specify which users and groups can access the DCOM application on the
                        computer both locally and remotely by using this setting. This will restore
                        control of the DCOM application to the administrator and users. To do this,
                        open the DCOM: Machine Access Restrictions in Security Descriptor Definition
                        Language (SDDL) syntax setting, and click Edit Security. Specify the groups
                        you want to include and the computer access permissions for those groups.
                        This defines the setting and sets the appropriate SDDL value.</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">Many COM applications include some security-specific
                        code (for example, to call CoInitializeSecurity) but use weak settings that
                        often allow unauthenticated access to the process. Administrators cannot
                        override these settings to force stronger security in earlier versions of
                        Windows without modifying the application. An attacker could attempt to
                        exploit weak security in an individual application by attacking it through
                        COM calls. Also, COM infrastructure includes the Remote Procedure Call
                        System Service (RPCSS), a system service that runs during computer startup
                        and always runs after that. This service manages activation of COM objects
                        and the running object table, and provides helper services to DCOM remoting.
                        It exposes RPC interfaces that can be called remotely. Because some COM
                        servers allow unauthenticated remote access, these interfaces can be called
                        by anyone, including unauthenticated users. As a result, RPCSS can be
                        attacked by malicious users who use remote, unauthenticated

                        different registry locations depending upon the version of Windows being
                        used. For Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 it is stored at

                              check box. It is also possible to configure this policy setting
                              through Group Policy or by using the Internet Explorer Administrators
                              Kit. Client computers running Windows XP, Windows XP SP1 and Windows
                              XP SP2 that try to connect to a Terminal Services server that has this
                              setting enabled will be unable to communicate with the server until an

                           <p>The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server
                              2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the
                              SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication,
                              which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message
                              authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing
                              provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each
                              SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.
                              Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance,
                              because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings
                              are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a
                              small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file
                              server, print server, and application server performance may be
                              substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to
                              ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and
                              operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you
                              completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to
                              session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on
                              domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers

                        authenticate as Guest only to receive the same access level to a given
                        resource.</description>

                        authenticate to your computer over the network does so with guest
                        privileges, which probably means that they will not have write access to
                        shared resources on that computer. Although this restriction does increase
                        security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared
                        resources on those computers because ACLs on those resources must include
                        access control entries (ACEs) for the Guest account. With the Classic model,
                        local accounts should be password protected. Otherwise, if Guest access is
                        enabled, anyone can use those user accounts to access shared system

                              authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing
                              provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each
                              SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.
                              Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance,
                              because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings

                              substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to
                              ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and
                              operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you
                              completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to
                              session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on
                              domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers

                              4.0 with Service Pack 6a (SP6a) and subsequent versions of the Windows
                              operating system support digital encryption and signing of the secure
                              channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not support it unless
                              they have the Dsclient installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the

                              running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will

                              version of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a in a trusted
                              domain will be disabled. You can enable this policy setting after you
                              eliminate all Windows 9x clients from the domain and upgrade all

                        have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end,
                        or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and
                        modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so
                        that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the

                        NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and
                        the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication
                        process, data transmission will not take place.</rationale>

                           <p>The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server
                              2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the
                              SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication,
                              which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message
                              authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing
                              provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each
                              SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.
                              Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance,
                              because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings
                              are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a
                              small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file
                              server, print server, and application server performance may be
                              substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to
                              ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and
                              operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you
                              completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to
                              session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on
                              domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers

                              events generated can make it difficult to find other types of entries

                        have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end,
                        or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and
                        modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so
                        that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the

                        NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and

                              2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the
                              SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication,

                              authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing
                              provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each
                              SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.
                              Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance,
                              because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings
                              are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a
                              small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file
                              server, print server, and application server performance may be
                              substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to
                              ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and
                              operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you
                              completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to
                              session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on
                              domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers

                        computers can prove their identities without sending a password to the
                        server. The protocol employs three types of messages to negotiate the
                        request, challenge the authenticity of the sender, and perform the
                        authentication. Kerberos is a more robust protocol and is the preferred
                        method of authentication when available.</rationale>

                        create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects,
                        such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of
                        file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer
                        (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can
                        be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between
                        a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the
                        Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just
                        another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is
                        implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system. Symbolic links can
                        potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not
                        designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic
                        links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only
                        Administrators can create symbolic links. When configuring a user right in

                        access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur
                        when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not
                        synchronized with the domain controllers.</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">Users who can change the time on a computer could
                        cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could
                        be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or
                        modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not
                        be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain
                        from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that
                        the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an
                        administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time
                        may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.
                        The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain controllers,
                        member servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service
                        automatically synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following
                        ways: . All client desktop computers and member servers use the
                        authenticating domain controller as their inbound time partner. . All domain
                        controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain controller (PDC)
                        emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. . All PDC emulator
                        operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their
                        inbound time partner. . The PDC emulator operations master at the root of
                        the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is
                        recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable
                        external time server. This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an
                        attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time
                        service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not
                        accurate.</rationale>

                        computer workstations to a specific domain. For this policy setting to take
                        effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the Default Domain
                        Controller Policy for the domain. A user who has been assigned this right
                        can add up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users who have been assigned
                        the Create Computer Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container
                        in Active Directory can add an unlimited number of computers to the domain,
                        regardless of whether they have been assigned the Add workstations to a
                        domain user right. By default, all users in the Authenticated Users group
                        have the ability to add up to 10 computer accounts to an Active Directory
                        domain. These new computer accounts are created in the Computers container.
                        In Windowsbased networks, the term security principal is defined as a user,
                        group, or computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to
                        control access to resources. In an Active Directory domain, each computer
                        account is a full security principal with the ability to authenticate and
                        access domain resources. However, some organizations may want to limit the
                        number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can
                        consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to
                        add computers to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be
                        hampered. Also, users could perform activities that are more difficult to
                        trace because of their ability to create additional unauthorized domain
                        computers. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited
                        list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active
                        Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers.</description>

                        policies. For example, if your organization does not want its users to have
                        administrative privileges on their computers, a user could install Windows
                        on his or her computer and then add the computer to the domain. The user
                        would know the password for the local administrator account, and could log
                        on with that account and then add his or her domain account to the local

                        bypass traverse checking. Permissions to files and folders are controlled
                        though appropriate configuration of file system access control lists (ACLs),
                        as the ability to traverse the folder does not provide any read or write
                        permissions to the user. The only scenario in which the default
                        configuration could lead to a mishap would be if the administrator who
                        configures permissions does not understand how this policy setting works.
                        For example, the administrator might expect that users who are unable to
                        access a folder will be unable to access the contents of any child folders.
                        Such a situation is unlikely, and therefore this vulnerability presents

                              administrators to terminate processes that they did not start. Also,
                              some older versions of Update.exe (which is used to install Windows
                              product updates) require the account that applies the update to have

                        access a folder will be unable to access the contents of any child folders.
                        Such a situation is unlikely, and therefore this vulnerability presents

                        in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right can affect the
                        appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged
                        events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred.
                        When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of
                        accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they
                        can be groups, users, or computers. Note: Discrepancies between the time on
                        the local computer and on the domain controllers in your environment may
                        cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it
                        impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to
                        access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur
                        when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not
                        synchronized with the domain controllers.</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">Users who can change the time on a computer could
                        cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could
                        be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or
                        modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not
                        be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain
                        from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that
                        the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an
                        administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time
                        may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.
                        The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain controllers,
                        member servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service
                        automatically synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following
                        ways: . All client desktop computers and member servers use the
                        authenticating domain controller as their inbound time partner. . All domain
                        controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain controller (PDC)
                        emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. . All PDC emulator
                        operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their
                        inbound time partner. . The PDC emulator operations master at the root of
                        the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is
                        recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable
                        external time server. This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an
                        attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time
                        service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not
                        accurate.</rationale>

                        access domain resources. However, some organizations may want to limit the
                        number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can
                        consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to
                        add computers to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be
                        hampered. Also, users could perform activities that are more difficult to
                        trace because of their ability to create additional unauthorized domain
                        computers. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited

                        behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or another specified account) so
                        that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for
                        this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to
                        convince a client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or
                        named pipes—to a service that they have created to impersonate that client,
                        which could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or
                        system levels. Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have
                        the built-in Service group added by default to their access tokens. COM
                        servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run
                        under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access
                        tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they
                        are started. Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the
                        following conditions exist: . The access token that is being impersonated is
                        for this user. . The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network
                        with explicit credentials to create the access token. . The requested level
                        is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify. An attacker with
                        the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a
                        service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then
                        impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of

                           be generated, and only when they are accessed in a manner matching their
                           SACL. By itself, this policy setting will not cause auditing of any
                           events. It determines whether to audit the event of a user who accesses a
                           file system object that has a specified system access control list
                           (SACL), effectively enabling auditing to take place. A SACL is comprised
                           of access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains three pieces of
                           information: . The security principal (user, computer, or group) to be
                           audited. . The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask.
                           . A flag to indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful
                           access events, or both. If you configure the Audit object access setting
                           to Success, an audit entry is generated each time that a user
                           successfully accesses an object with a specified SACL. If you configure
                           this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated each time
                           that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified
                           SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when
                           they configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and
                           Append Data auditing setting on executable files to track when they are
                           changed or replaced, because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
                           typically target executable files. Similarly, you might want to track
                           when sensitive documents are accessed or changed. Events for this
                           subcategory include: 4664: An attempt was made to create a hard link.
                           4985: The state of a transaction has changed. 5051: A file was
                           virtualized. Refer to the Microsoft Knowledgebase article Description of
                           security events in Windows Vista and in Windows Server 2008 for the most

                           difficult or impossible to determine what occurred during a security
                           incident. However, if audit settings are configured so that events are
                           generated for all activities the Security log will be filled with data

                        <description xml:lang="en">This subcategory reports when registry objects
                           are accessed. Only registry objects with SACLs cause audit events to be
                           generated, and only when they are accessed in a manner matching their
                           SACL. By itself, this policy setting will not cause auditing of any
                           events. It determines whether to audit the event of a user who accesses a
                           registry object that has a specified system access control list (SACL),
                           effectively enabling auditing to take place. A SACL is comprised of
                           access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains three pieces of
                           information: . The security principal (user, computer, or group) to be
                           audited. . The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask.
                           . A flag to indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful
                           access events, or both. If you configure the Audit object access setting
                           to Success, an audit entry is generated each time that a user
                           successfully accesses an object with a specified SACL. If you configure
                           this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated each time
                           that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified
                           SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when
                           they configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and
                           Append Data auditing setting on executable files to track when they are
                           changed or replaced, because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
                           typically target executable files. Similarly, you might want to track
                           when sensitive documents are accessed or changed. Events for this
                           subcategory include: 4657 : A registry value was modified. 5039: A
                           registry key was virtualized. Refer to the Microsoft Knowledgebase

                           accessed. By itself, this policy setting will not cause auditing of any
                           events. It determines whether to audit the event of a user who accesses a
                           file share object that has a specified system access control list (SACL),
                           effectively enabling auditing to take place. A SACL is comprised of
                           access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains three pieces of
                           information: . The security principal (user, computer, or group) to be
                           audited. . The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask.
                           . A flag to indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful
                           access events, or both. If you configure the Audit object access setting
                           to Success, an audit entry is generated each time that a user
                           successfully accesses an object with a specified SACL. If you configure
                           this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated each time
                           that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified
                           SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when
                           they configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and
                           Append Data auditing setting on executable files to track when they are
                           changed or replaced, because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
                           typically target executable files. Similarly, you might want to track
                           when sensitive documents are accessed or changed. Events for this
                           subcategory include: 5140: A network share object was accessed. Refer to

                           Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). The types of changes that are
                           reported are create, modify, move, and undelete operations that are
                           performed on an object. DS Change auditing, where appropriate, indicates
                           the old and new values of the changed properties of the objects that were
                           changed. Only objects with SACLs cause audit events to be generated, and
                           only when they are accessed in a manner that matches their SACL. Some
                           objects and properties do not cause audit events to be generated due to
                           settings on the object class in the schema. This subcategory applies only
                           to domain controllers. Events for this subcategory include: 5136 : A

                           Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory
                           include: 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity
                           check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or
                           that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that
                           the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received
                           by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability
                           problems with other IPsec implementations. 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound
                           packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could
                           indicate a replay attack against this computer. 4962: IPsec dropped an
                           inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low
                           a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. 4963: IPsec dropped an
                           inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually
                           due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing
                           this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. 4965: IPsec
                           received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security
                           Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware
                           that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the
                           packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by
                           this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems
                           with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not
                           impeded, then these events can be ignored. 5478: IPsec Services has
                           started successfully. 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down
                           successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at
                           greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential
                           security risks. 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of
                           network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk
                           because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection
                           provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor
                           snap-in to diagnose the problem. 5483: IPsec Services failed to
                           initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started. 5484: IPsec
                           Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The
                           shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of
                           network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5485:
                           IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play
                           event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk
                           because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection
                           provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor
                           snap-in to diagnose the problem. Refer to the Microsoft Knowledgebase

                              default behavior is to allow connections unless there are firewall
                              rules that block the connection. Important If you set Outbound
                              connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using a
                              GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent
                              Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule
                              that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core
                              Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work.
                              Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test
                              firewall profiles before deploying.</description>
                           <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block
                              all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the
                              user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking
                              outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large
                              number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block
                              applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software.
                              Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an
                              attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall
                              anyway.</rationale>

                              outbound connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. The
                              default behavior is to allow connections unless there are firewall
                              rules that block the connection. Important If you set Outbound
                              connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using a
                              GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent
                              Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule
                              that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core
                              Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work.
                              Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test
                              firewall profiles before deploying.</description>
                           <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block
                              all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the
                              user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking
                              outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large
                              number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block
                              applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software.
                              Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an
                              attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall
                              anyway.</rationale>

                           number of failed logon attempts before a lock occurs. Authorized users
                           can lock themselves out of an account by mistyping their password or by
                           remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer
                           while logged on to another computer. The computer with the incorrect
                           password will continuously try to authenticate the user, and because the
                           password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock occurs. To avoid
                           accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold
                           to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid
                           logon attempts, which disables the account lockout feature.</p>

                           should determine whether to use this policy setting based on identified
                           threats and the risks you want to mitigate. There are two options to
                           consider for this policy setting.</p>
                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">#x2022; Configure the value for
                           Account lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that accounts will not be locked
                           out. This setting value will prevent a DoS attack that attempts to lock
                           out accounts in your organization. It will also reduce help desk calls,
                           because users will not be able to lock themselves out of their accounts
                           accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a brute force
                           attack. The following defenses should also be considered:</p>
                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">#x2022; A password policy that
                           forces all users to have complex passwords made up of 8 or more
                           characters.</p>
                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">#x2022; A robust auditing mechanism,
                           which will alert administrators when a series of account lockouts occurs
                           in the environment. For example, the auditing solution should monitor for
                           security event 539, which is a logon failure. This event identifies that
                           there was a lock on the account at the time of the logon attempt.</p>
                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second option is:</p>

                           Account lockout threshold to a value that provides users with the ability
                           to mistype their password several times, but locks out the account if a
                           brute force password attack occurs. This configuration will prevent
                           accidental account lockouts and reduce help desk calls, but will not
                           prevent a DoS attack.</p>

                           There are many different theories about how to determine the best
                           password length for an organization, but perhaps "pass phrase" is a
                           better term than "password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass
                           phrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase
                           such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid pass phrase; it is a
                           considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random
                           numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be
                           educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords,
                           especially with regard to password length.</p>

                                 passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk
                                 is that users may create passwords that change incrementally (for
                                 example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate
                                 memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an excessively
                                 low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase
                                 administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords

                           attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities),
                           it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic
                           password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character
                           case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627

                           combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000

                                 additional help desk calls for locked-out accounts could occur
                                 because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain
                                 non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to
                                 comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.</p>
                              <p>If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you
                                 can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows
                                 the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For
                                 example, a custom password filter might require the use of
                                 non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that
                                 require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits
                                 between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a
                                 dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not
                                 contain common dictionary words or fragments.</p>
                              <p>Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance
                                 the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password
                                 requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help
                                 desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement
                                 for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the
                                 0128-0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can
                                 represent standard alphanumeric characters that would not add
                                 additional complexity to the password.)</p>

                           <p>When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information
                              unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will
                              overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate
                              the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
                              method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence
                              of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the
                              logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because
                              they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any
                              evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you
                              automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all
                              specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses

                  <description xml:lang="en">Directs Windows Installer to use system permissions
                     when it installs any program on the system. This setting extends elevated
                     privileges to all programs. These privileges are usually reserved for programs
                     that have been assigned to the user (offered on the desktop), assigned to the
                     computer (installed automatically), or made available in Add or Remove Programs
                     in Control Panel. This setting lets users install programs that require access
                     to directories that the user might not have permission to view or change,
                     including directories on highly restricted computers. If you disable this
                     setting or do not configure it, the system applies the current user's
                     permissions when it installs programs that a system administrator does not
                     distribute or offer. Note: This setting appears both in the Computer
                     Configuration and User Configuration folders. To make this setting effective,
                     you must enable the setting in both folders. Caution: Skilled users can take
                     advantage of the permissions this setting grants to change their privileges and
                     gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note that the User
                     Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be
                     secure.</description>
