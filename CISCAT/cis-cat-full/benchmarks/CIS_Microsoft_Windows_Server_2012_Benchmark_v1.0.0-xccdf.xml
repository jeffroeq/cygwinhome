   <notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</notice>

               <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before a lock occurs. Authorized users can lock themselves out of an account by mistyping their password or by remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer while logged on to another computer. The computer with the incorrect password will continuously try to authenticate the user, and because the password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock occurs. To avoid accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid logon attempts, which disables the account lockout feature.
Because it is possible for an attacker to use this lockout state as a denial of service (DoS) by triggering a lockout on a large number of accounts, your organization should determine whether to use this policy setting based on identified threats and the risks you want to mitigate. There are two options to consider for this policy setting.
- Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that accounts will not be locked out. This setting value will prevent a DoS attack that attempts to lock out accounts in your organization. It will also reduce help desk calls, because users will not be able to lock themselves out of their accounts accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a brute force attack. The following defenses should also be considered:
- A password policy that forces all users to have complex passwords made up of 8 or more characters.
- A robust auditing mechanism, which will alert administrators when a series of account lockouts occurs in the environment. For example, the auditing solution should monitor for security event 539, which is a logon failure. This event identifies that there was a lock on the account at the time of the logon attempt.
The second option is:
- Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to a value that provides users with the ability to mistype their password several times, but locks out the account if a brute force password attack occurs. This configuration will prevent accidental account lockouts and reduce help desk calls, but will not prevent a DoS attack. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">5 invalid logon attempt(s)</span>.</description>
               <rationale xml:lang="en">Password attacks can use automated methods to try millions of password combinations for any user account. The effectiveness of such attacks can be almost eliminated if you limit the number of failed logons that can be performed.
However, a DoS attack could be performed on a domain that has an account lockout threshold configured. An attacker could programmatically attempt a series of password attacks against all users in the organization. If the number of attempts is greater than the account lockout threshold, the attacker might be able to lock out every account.</rationale>

If you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by deliberately generating failed logons for multiple user, therefore you should also configure the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value such as 15 minutes.
If you configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an attacker's attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack might go undetected if a robust audit mechanism is not in place.</p>

There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps "pass phrase" is a better term than "password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass phrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid pass phrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length.<br/>In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements.

Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">Enabled</span>.</description>

                     <p>If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.
If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments.
Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 01280159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)</p>

To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0.

These events occur on the computer that is authoritative for the credentials. For domain accounts, the domain controller is authoritative, whereas for local accounts, the local computer is authoritative. In domain environments, most of the Account Logon events occur in the Security log of the domain controllers that are authoritative for the domain accounts. However, these events can occur on other computers in the organization when local accounts are used to log on.

It determines whether to audit the event of a user who accesses a file share object that has a specified system access control list (SACL), effectively enabling auditing to take place.
A SACL is comprised of access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains three pieces of information:
- The security principal (user, computer, or group) to be audited.
- The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask.
- A flag to indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful access events, or both.
If you configure the Audit object access setting to Success, an audit entry is generated each time that a user successfully accesses an object with a specified SACL. If you configure this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated each time that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified SACL.
Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when they configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and Append Data auditing setting on executable files to track when they are changed or replaced, because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses typically target executable files. Similarly, you might want to track when sensitive documents are accessed or changed.

               <description xml:lang="en">This subcategory reports when registry objects are accessed. Only registry objects with SACLs cause audit events to be generated, and only when they are accessed in a manner matching their SACL. By itself, this policy setting will not cause auditing of any events. It determines whether to audit the event of a user who accesses a registry object that has a specified system access control list (SACL), effectively enabling auditing to take place.
A SACL is comprised of access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains three pieces of information:
- The security principal (user, computer, or group) to be audited.
- The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask.
- A flag to indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful access events, or both.
If you configure the Audit object access setting to Success, an audit entry is generated each time that a user successfully accesses an object with a specified SACL. If you configure this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated each time that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified SACL.
Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when they configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and Append Data auditing setting on executable files to track when they are changed or replaced, because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses typically target executable files. Similarly, you might want to track when sensitive documents are accessed or changed.
Events for this subcategory include:
 4657 : A registry value was modified.
 5039: A registry key was virtualized.

               <description xml:lang="en">This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory include:
 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. 
 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. 
 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. 
 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. 
 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. 
 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully. 
 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 
 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem. 
 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started. 
 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 
 5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.

               <rationale xml:lang="en">If audit settings are not configured, it can be difficult or impossible to determine what occurred during a security incident. However, if audit settings are configured so that events are generated for all activities the Security log will be filled with data and hard to use. Also, you can use a large amount of data storage as well as adversely affect overall computer performance if you configure audit settings for a large number of objects.
If failure auditing is used and the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting in the Security Options section of Group Policy is enabled, an attacker could generate millions of failure events such as logon failures in order to fill the Security log and force the computer to shut down, creating a Denial of Service. If security logs are allowed to be overwritten, an attacker can overwrite part or all of their activity by generating large numbers of events so that the evidence of their intrusion is overwritten.</rationale>

If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.<br/>The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an attacker might use a bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account a popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of this countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name. Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on.</p>

 Important 
Be very cautious about audit settings that can generate a large volume of traffic. For example, if you enable either success or failure auditing for all of the Privilege Use subcategories, the high volume of audit events generated can make it difficult to find other types of entries in the Security log. Such a configuration could also have a significant impact on system performance.</p>

You can use this policy setting to specify access permissions to all the computers to particular users for DCOM applications in the enterprise. When you specify the users or groups that are to be given permission, the security descriptor field is populated with the Security Descriptor Definition Language representation of those groups and privileges. If the security descriptor is left blank, the policy setting is defined in the template, but it is not enforced. Users and groups can be given explicit Allow or Deny privileges on both local access and remote access.

The registry settings that are created as a result of enabling the DCOM: Machine Access Restrictions in Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) syntax policy setting take precedence over (have higher priority) the previous registry settings in this area. RpcSs checks the new registry keys in the Policies section for the computer restrictions, and these registry entries take precedence over the existing registry keys under OLE. This means that previously existing registry settings are no longer effective, and if you make changes to the existing settings, the computer access permissions for any users are not changed. You should take care to correctly configure their list of users and groups.

The possible values for this policy setting are:

Blank. This represents the local security policy way of deleting the policy enforcement key. This value deletes the policy and then sets it as Not defined state. The Blank value is set by using the ACL editor and emptying the list, and then pressing OK.

SDDL. This is the Security Descriptor Definition Language representation of the groups and privileges you specify when you enable this policy. 

Not Defined. This is the default value.

  Note
If the administrator is denied permission to access DCOM applications due to the changes made to DCOM in SP2, the administrator can use the DCOM: Machine Access Restrictions in Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) syntax policy setting to manage DCOM access to the computer. The administrator can specify which users and groups can access the DCOM application on the computer both locally and remotely by using this setting. This will restore control of the DCOM application to the administrator and users. To do this, open the DCOM: Machine Access Restrictions in Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) syntax setting, and click Edit Security. Specify the groups you want to include and the computer access permissions for those groups. This defines the setting and sets the appropriate SDDL value. Configure this setting in a manner that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your organization.</description>
                  <rationale xml:lang="en">Many COM applications include some security-specific code (for example, to call CoInitializeSecurity) but use weak settings that often allow unauthenticated access to the process. Administrators cannot override these settings to force stronger security in earlier versions of Windows without modifying the application. An attacker could attempt to exploit weak security in an individual application by attacking it through COM calls.
Also, COM infrastructure includes the Remote Procedure Call System Service (RPCSS), a system service that runs during computer startup and always runs after that. This service manages activation of COM objects and the running object table, and provides helper services to DCOM remoting. It exposes RPC interfaces that can be called remotely.

                  <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting determines which users or groups might launch or activate DCOM applications remotely or locally. This setting is used to control the attack surface of the computer for DCOM applications.

You can use this Group Policy setting to grant access to all the computers to particular users for DCOM application in the enterprise. When you define this setting, and specify the users or groups that are to be given permission, the security descriptor field is populated with the Security Descriptor Definition Language representation of those groups and privileges. If the security descriptor is left blank, the policy setting is defined in the template, but it is not enforced. Users and groups can be given explicit Allow or Deny privileges on local launch, remote launch, local activation, and remote activation.

The registry settings that are created as a result of this policy take precedence over the previous registry settings in this area. RpcSs checks the new registry keys in the Policies section for the computer restrictions; these entries take precedence over the existing registry keys under OLE.

The possible values for this Group Policy setting are:

Blank. This represents the local security policy way of deleting the policy enforcement key. This value deletes the policy and then sets it to Not defined state. The Blank value is set by using the ACL editor and emptying the list, and then pressing OK.

SDDL. This is the Security Descriptor Definition Language representation of the groups and privileges you specify when you enable this policy.

Not Defined. This is the default value.

  Note
If the administrator is denied access to activate and launch DCOM applications due to the changes made to DCOM in SP2, this policy setting can be used for controlling the DCOM activation and launch to the computer. The administrator can specify which users and groups can launch and activate DCOM applications on the computer both locally and remotely by using the DCOM: Machine Launch Restrictions in Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) syntax policy setting. This restores control of the DCOM application to the administrator and specified users. To do this, open the DCOM: Machine Launch Restrictions in Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) syntax setting, and click Edit Security. Specify the groups you want to include and the computer launch permissions for those groups. This defines the setting and sets the appropriate SDDL value. Configure this setting in a manner that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your organization.</description>
                  <rationale xml:lang="en">Many COM applications include some security-specific code (for example, to call CoInitializeSecurity) but use weak settings that often allow unauthenticated access to the process. Administrators cannot override these settings to force stronger security in earlier versions of Windows without modifying the application. An attacker could attempt to exploit weak security in an individual application by attacking it through COM calls.
Also, COM infrastructure includes the RPCSS, a system service that runs during computer startup and always runs after that. This service manages activation of COM objects and the running object table and provides helper services to DCOM remoting. It exposes RPC interfaces that can be called remotely.

In such attacks, an intruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then forwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could cause a client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP directory. To lower the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you could implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult.</p>

Computers that are no longer able to automatically change their account password are at risk from an attacker who could determine the password for the computer's domain account.</rationale>

An attacker could install a Trojan horse program that looks like the standard Windows logon dialog box and capture the user's password. The attacker would then be able to log on to the compromised account with whatever level of privilege that user has.</rationale>

Authorized users can lock themselves out of the computer by mistyping their password or by remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer while logged on to another computer. The computer with the incorrect password will continuously try to authenticate the user, and because the password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock occurs. To avoid accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid logon attempts, which disables the machine lockout feature. There are two options to consider for this policy setting.</p>

                        <li>Configure the value for Machine lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that accounts will not be locked out. This setting value will reduce help desk calls, because users will not be able to lock themselves out of their accounts accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a brute force attack. The following defenses should also be considered:</li>
                        <li>A password policy that forces all users to have complex passwords made up of 8 or more characters.</li>
                        <li>A robust auditing mechanism, which will alert administrators when a series of account lockouts occurs in the environment. For example, the auditing solution should monitor for security event 539, which is a logon failure. This event identifies that there was a lock on the account at the time of the logon attempt.</li>
                        <li>The second option is:</li>
                        <li>Configure the value for Machine lockout threshold to a value that provides users with the ability to mistype their password several times, but locks out the account if a brute force password attack occurs.

                           <p>Because vulnerabilities can exist when this value is configured as well as when it is not configured, two distinct countermeasures are defined. Any organization should weigh the choice between the two based on their identified threats and the risks that they want to mitigate. The two countermeasure options are:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>Configure the Machine Lockout Threshold setting to 0. This configuration ensures that accounts will not be locked out, and also helps reduce help desk calls because users cannot accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts. Because it will not prevent a brute force attack, this configuration should only be chosen if both of the following criteria are explicitly met:</li>
                              <li>The password policy requires all users to have complex passwords of 8 or more characters.</li>
                              <li>A robust audit mechanism is in place to alert administrators when a series of failed logons occur in the environment.</li>
                              <li>Configure the Machine Lockout Threshold setting to a sufficiently high value to provide users with the ability to accidentally mistype their password several times before the machine is locked, but ensure that a brute force password attack will still lock the account. A good recommendation for such a configuration is 50 invalid logon attempts, which will prevent accidental account lockouts and reduce the number of help desk calls. This option is recommended if your organization does not have complex password requirements and an audit policy that alerts administrators to a series of failed logon attempts.</li>

You can configure a computer so that it does not send announcements to browsers on the domain. If you do so, you hide the computer from the Browse list, which means that the computer will stop announcing itself to other computers on the same network. An attacker who knows the name of a computer can more easily gather additional information about the system. You can enable this setting to remove one method that an attacker might use to gather information about computers on the network. Also, this setting can help reduce network traffic when enabled.

The entry appears as MSS: (NoDefaultExempt) Configure IPSec exemptions for various types of network traffic in the SCE.
The default exemptions to IPsec policy filters are documented in the online help for the specific operating system. These filters make it possible for Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and the Kerberos authentication protocol to function. The filters also make it possible for the network Quality of Service (QoS) to be signaled (RSVP) when the data traffic is secured by IPsec, and for traffic that IPsec might not secure such as multicast and broadcast traffic.
IPsec is increasingly used for basic host-firewall packet filtering, particularly in Internet-exposed scenarios, and the affect of these default exemptions has not been fully understood. Therefore, some IPsec administrators may create IPsec policies that they think are secure, but are not actually secure against inbound attacks that use the default exemptions.
For additional information, see the Knowledge Base article 811832, "IPSec Default Exemptions Can Be Used to Bypass IPsec Protection in Some Scenarios." Configure this setting in a manner that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your organization.</description>

NetBIOS over TCP/IP is a network protocol that among other things provides a way to easily resolve NetBIOS names that are registered on Windowsbased systems to the IP addresses that are configured on those systems. This setting determines whether the computer releases its NetBIOS name when it receives a name-release request. Configure this setting in a manner that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your organization.</description>
                  <rationale xml:lang="en">The NetBT protocol is designed not to use authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. A malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated nature of the protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which would cause the computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries.
The result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues on the target computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood, domain logons, the NET SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution.

- Search folders specified in the system path first, and then search the current working folder.
- Search current working folder first, and then search the folders specified in the system path.
When enabled, the registry value is set to 1. With a setting of 1, the system first searches the folders that are specified in the system path and then searches the current working folder. When disabled the registry value is set to 0 and the system first searches the current working folder and then searches the folders that are specified in the system path. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">Enabled</span>.</description>

                  <description xml:lang="en">Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 introduce an extension to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decides whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U. You can also develop or add other SSPs.
When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.
This policy will be turned off by default on domain joined machines. This would disallow the online identities to be able to authenticate to the domain joined machine in Windows 7. Configure this setting in a manner that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your organization.</description>
                  <rationale xml:lang="en">The PKU2U protocol is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol, in most managed networks authentication should be managed centrally.</rationale>

Kerberos is a more robust protocol and is the preferred method of authentication when available.</rationale>

However, in Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP clients are configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default setting on servers allows all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this means that LM responses#x2014;the weakest form of authentication response#x2014;are sent over the network, and it is potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.<br/>The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for earlier clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.</p>

For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means of IPsec authentication headers.</rationale>

The possible values for the Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients setting are:

- Require message confidentiality. This option is only available in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the connection will fail if encryption is not negotiated. Encryption converts data into a form that is not readable until decrypted.

The integrity of a message can be assessed through message signing. Message signing proves that the message has not been tampered with; it attaches a cryptographic signature that identifies the sender and is a numeric representation of the contents of the message. 

- Require 128-bit encryption. The connection will fail if strong encryption (128-bit) is not negotiated.

                        <p>Users will have to enter their password every time they access a key that is stored on their computer. For example, if users use an S-MIME certificate to digitally sign their e-mail they will be forced to enter the password for that certificate every time they send a signed e-mail message. For some organizations the overhead that is involved using this configuration may be too high. 

For end user computers that are used to access sensitive data this setting could be set to "User is prompted when the key is first used," but Microsoft does not recommend enforcing this setting on servers due to the significant impact on manageability. For example, if this setting is configured to "User is prompted when the key is first used" you may not be able to configure Remote Desktop Services to use SSL certificates.

Although this policy setting increases security, most public Web sites that are secured with TLS or SSL do not support these algorithms. Client computers that have this policy setting enabled will also be unable to connect to Terminal Services on servers that are not configured to use the FIPS compliant algorithms.
Note   If you enable this policy setting, computer performance will be slower because the 3DES process is performed on each block of data in the file three times. This policy setting should only be enabled if your organization is required to be FIPS compliant.
Important: This setting is recorded in different registry locations depending upon the version of Windows being used. For Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 it is stored at HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy, with Windows Vista and later versions of Windows it is stored at HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy\Enabled. This means that you must use Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 to edit group policies and security templates which will be applied to computers running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. However, when editing group policies or security templates which will be applied to computers running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 you must use Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008.

                        <p>Client computers that have this policy setting enabled will be unable to communicate by means of digitally encrypted or signed protocols with servers that do not support these algorithms. Network clients that do not support these algorithms will not be able to use servers that require them for network communications. For example, many Apache-based Web servers are not configured to support TLS. If you enable this setting, you also need to configure Internet Explorer to use TLS. This policy setting also affects the encryption level that is used for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The Remote Desktop Connection tool uses the RDP protocol to communicate with servers that run Terminal Services and client computers that are configured for remote control; RDP connections will fail if both computers are not configured to use the same encryption algorithms.
 To enable Internet Explore to use TLS
1. On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
2. Click the Advanced tab.
3. Select the Use TLS 1.0 check box.
It is also possible to configure this policy setting through Group Policy or by using the Internet Explorer Administrators Kit.

Client computers running Windows XP, Windows XP SP1 and Windows XP SP2 that try to connect to a Terminal Services server that has this setting enabled will be unable to communicate with the server until an updated version of the Terminal Services client is installed. This issue could allo affect Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop connections. For more information about the issue and how to resolve it see "Remote Assistance connection to Windows Server 2003 with FIPS encryption does not work" at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;811770.

Microsoft .NET Framework applications such as Microsoft ASP.NET that use use cryptographic algorithms which are not validated by NIST to be FIPS 140 compliant may fail. Use of cryptographic algorithm classes that are not FIPS validated will cause an InvalidOperationException exception to occur. See ""System cryptography: Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing" security setting effects in Windows XP and in later versions of Windows" for more information: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811833.

An attack vector for these programs was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator" because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows Vista the built-in Administrator account is disabled. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two ways:
- If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator.
- If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and create one if a local administrator account is warranted. 
Once Windows Vista is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be enabled, but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.</rationale>

For this policy setting to take effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the Default Domain Controller Policy for the domain. A user who has been assigned this right can add up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users who have been assigned the Create Computer Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active Directory can add an unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of whether they have been assigned the Add workstations to a domain user right.<br/>By default, all users in the Authenticated Users group have the ability to add up to 10 computer accounts to an Active Directory domain. These new computer accounts are created in the Computers container.<br/>In Windowsbased networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control access to resources. In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security principal with the ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However, some organizations may want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to add computers to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be hampered. Also, users could perform activities that are more difficult to trace because of their ability to create additional unauthorized domain computers.<br/>

               <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred.

When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers.

Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the domain controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the domain controllers. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">LOCAL SERVICE, Administrators</span>.</description>
               <rationale xml:lang="en">Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.
The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain controllers, member servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following ways:
• All client desktop computers and member servers use the authenticating domain controller as their inbound time partner.
• All domain controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.
• All PDC emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner.
• The PDC emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server.
This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate.</rationale>

               <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can create symbolic links.

Note   Microsoft released several security updates in October 2003 that used a version of Update.exe that required the administrator to have the Debug programs user right. Administrators who did not have this user right were unable to install these security updates until they reconfigured their user rights. This is not typical behavior for operating system updates.

                     <p>If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. However, typical circumstances rarely require this capability on production computers. If a problem arises that requires an application to be debugged on a production server, you can move the server to a different OU temporarily and assign the Debug programs user right to a separate Group Policy for that OU.
The service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs privilege; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail. For additional information about how to configure Windows Clustering in conjunction with computer hardening, see article 891597, How to apply more restrictive security settings on a Windows Server 2003based cluster server, in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=100746).
Tools that are used to manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not owned by the person who runs the tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit tool Kill.exe requires this user right for administrators to terminate processes that they did not start.
Also, some older versions of Update.exe (which is used to install Windows product updates) require the account that applies the update to have this user right. If you install one of the patches that uses this version of Update.exe, the computer could become unresponsive. For more information, see article 830846, Windows Product Updates may stop responding or may use most or all the CPU resources, in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=100747).</p>

               <description xml:lang="en">The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or another specified account) so that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to convince a client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes—to a service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.
Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added by default to their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they are started.
Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist:
- The access token that is being impersonated is for this user.
- The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network with explicit credentials to create the access token.
- The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify.
An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.

Important   If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work. Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles before deploying. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">Allow (default)</span>.</description>
                  <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall anyway.</rationale>

                  <description xml:lang="en">This setting determines the behavior for outbound connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. The default behavior is to allow connections unless there are firewall rules that block the connection. 
Important   If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work. Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles before deploying. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">Allow (default)</span>.</description>
                  <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall anyway.</rationale>

                  <description xml:lang="en">This setting determines the behavior for outbound connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. In Windows Vista, the default behavior is to allow connections unless there are firewall rules that block the connection. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">Allow (default)</span>.</description>
                  <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall anyway.</rationale>
