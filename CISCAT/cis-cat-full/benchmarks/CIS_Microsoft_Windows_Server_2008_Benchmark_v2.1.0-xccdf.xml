   <notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en"> BACKGROUND. The Center for Internet Security ("CIS")
      provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other
      services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to
      Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result
      from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally
      generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to
      organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and
      devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to
      specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick
      fix" for anyone's information security needs. NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
      CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or
      negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any
      particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of
      any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of the
      Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is"
      and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind. USER
      AGREEMENTS. By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We")
      agree and acknowledge that: 1. No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component
      can be made fully secure; 2. We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our
      own risk; 3. We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of
      the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from CIS's negligence or failure
      to perform; 4. We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the
      Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the Recommendations to our
      particular circumstances and requirements; 5. Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below)
      has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify
      us of the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and 6. Neither CIS
      nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract,
      tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or
      special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or
      damage to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of
      privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted
      management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties)
      arising out of or in any way Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the
      Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages),
      including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual
      property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other
      harmful items. GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS. CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but
      only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use: 1.
      Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written
      agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and use each of the Products on a single
      computer; 2. Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a
      Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are
      printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed
      Terms of Use in its entirety. RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON
      DISTRIBUTION. The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and
      by international treaties. We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any
      intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to
      the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS reserves all rights
      not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
      Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some
      classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have
      otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile,
      disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software
      Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute,
      encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any
      Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on
      any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device,
      without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or
      alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in
      any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter
      these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi)
      use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a
      Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product
      with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such
      Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a
      particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product. We will
      not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed
      in this paragraph. We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers,
      directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates,
      licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all
      other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or
      Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses,
      costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS
      Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding
      paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive
      defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree
      to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim. We further agree that all CIS Parties are
      third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. SPECIAL RULES. CIS
      has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other
      persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship. Those special
      rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are
      covered by the special rules. CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software
      Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains
      in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the
      right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization,
      whether by manual or electronic means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the
      foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and
      may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION;
      VENUE. We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and
      construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in
      equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the
      courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any of these
      Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable,
      then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
      of any remaining provisions. BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE
      AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN
      ALL RESPECTS.</notice>

                  <description xml:lang="en">Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service implements
                     the WS-Management protocol for remote management. WS-Management is a standard
                     web services protocol used for remote software and hardware management. The
                     WinRM service listens on the network for WS-Management requests and processes
                     them. The WinRM Service needs to be configured with a listener using winrm.cmd
                     command line tool or through Group Policy in order for it to listen over the
                     network. The WinRM service provides access to WMI data and enables event
                     collection. Event collection and subscription to events require that the
                     service is running. WinRM messages use HTTP and HTTPS as transports. The WinRM
                     service does not depend on IIS but is preconfigured to share a port with IIS on
                     the same machine. The WinRM service reserves the /wsman URL prefix. To prevent
                     conflicts with IIS, administrators should ensure that any websites hosted on
                     IIS do not use the /wsman URL prefix.</description>

                     ticket to another computer, it must request a TGT from the authentication
                     service in its account domain. The authentication service returns a TGT for the
                     ticket-granting service in the target computer's domain. The TGT can be reused

                        administrative or elevated access accounts. Be sure to also change the
                        default description for the local administrator (through the Computer

                        user names are omitted to ensure that organizations that implement this
                        guidance will not use the same new user name in their
                        environments.</description>

                        run the Windows operating systems. If you rename this account, it is
                        slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged
                        user name and password combination. The built-in Administrator account
                        cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an attacker might use a
                        bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account a popular
                        target for brute force attacks thattempt to guess passwords. The value of
                        this countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID,
                        and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID
                        rather than the account name. Therefore, even if you rename the
                        Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by
                        using the SID to log on.</rationale>

                     <rationale xml:lang="en">In some organizations, it can be a daunting management
                        challenge to maintain a regular schedule for periodic password changes for
                        local accounts. Therefore, you may want to disable the built-in
                        Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes to
                        protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is
                        that it cannot be locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues,
                        which makes it a prime target for brute force attacks thattempt to guess
                        passwords. Also, this account has a well-known security identifier (SID) and
                        there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID
                        rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you rename
                        the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by
                        using the SID to log on.</rationale>

                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows
                              Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows
                              Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available
                              from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledgebase

                              Administrators can deploy a custom audit policy that applies detailed
                              security auditing settings to Windows Vista-based client computers in
                              a Windows Server 2008 domain, Windows Server 2003 domain, or in a

                           <p>Digital encryption and signing of the â€œsecure channelâ€ is a
                              good idea where it is supported. The secure channel protects domain
                              credentials as they are sent to the domain controller. However, only
                              Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6a (SP6a) and subsequent versions of
                              the Windows operating system support digital encryption and signing of
                              the secure channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not support
                              it unless they have the Dsclient installed. Therefore, you cannot
                              enable the Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel

                              following: â€¢ The ability to create or delete trust relationships
                              with clients running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0
                              with SP6a will be disabled. â€¢ Logons from clients running versions
                              of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled. â€¢
                              The ability to authenticate other domainsâ€ users from a domain
                              controller running a version of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0
                              with SP6a in a trusted domain will be disabled. You can enable this
                              policy setting after you eliminate all Windows 9x clients from the
                              domain and upgrade all Windows NT 4.0 servers and domain controllers
                              from trusted/trusting domains to Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a. You can
                              enable the other two policy settings, Domain member: Digitally encrypt
                              secure channel data (when possible) and Domain member: Digitally

                              domain that support them and clients running versions of Windows
                              earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a and applications that run on

                           <p>The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print
                              sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against
                              session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to
                              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
                              authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is
                              then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB
                              signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs
                              to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server
                              that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server
                              that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and
                              application server performance may be substantially slowed.
                              Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB
                              communications, older applications and operating systems will not be
                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows
                              Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows
                              Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available

                        when entering the list is a line feed or carriage return, that is, type the

                           <p>The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print
                              sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against
                              session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to
                              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
                              authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is
                              then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB
                              signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs
                              to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server
                              that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server
                              that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and
                              application server performance may be substantially slowed.
                              Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB
                              communications, older applications and operating systems will not be
                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows
                              Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows
                              Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available

                        Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) Security Provider supports
                        only the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite. Although this policy
                        setting increases security, most public Web sites that are secured with TLS
                        or SSL do not support these algorithms. Client computers that have this
                        policy setting enabled will also be unable to connect to Terminal Services
                        on servers that are not configured to use the FIPS compliant algorithms.
                        Note If you enable this policy setting, computer performance will be slower
                        because the 3DES process is performed on each block of data in the file
                        three times. This policy setting should only be enabled if your organization
                        is required to be FIPS compliant. Important: This setting is recorded in
                        different registry locations depending upon the version of Windows being
                        used. For Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 it is stored at
                        HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy, with Windows
                        Vista and later versions of Windows it is stored at
                        HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy\Enabled. This
                        means that you must use Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 to edit group
                        policies and security templates which will be applied to computers running
                        Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. However, when editing group policies or
                        security templates which will be applied to computers running Windows Vista
                        or Windows Server 2008 you must use Windows Vista or Windows Server

                              that require them for network communications. For example, many
                              Apache-based Web servers are not configured to support TLS. If you
                              enable this setting, you also need to configure Internet Explorer to
                              use TLS. This policy setting also affects the encryption level that is
                              used for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The Remote Desktop
                              Connection tool uses the RDP protocol to communicate with servers that
                              run Terminal Services and client computers that are configured for
                              remote control; RDP connections will fail if both computers are not
                              configured to use the same encryption algorithms. To enable Internet
                              Explore to use TLS: 1. On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click
                              Internet Options. 2. Click the Advanced tab. 3. Select the Use TLS 1.0
                              check box. It is also possible to configure this policy setting
                              through Group Policy or by using the Internet Explorer Administrators
                              Kit. Client computers running Windows XP, Windows XP SP1 and Windows
                              XP SP2 that try to connect to a Terminal Services server that has this
                              setting enabled will be unable to communicate with the server until an

                              configure Remote Desktop Services to use SSL certificates. More

                        For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a

                        introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious
                        software running under elevated credentials without the user or
                        administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these
                        programs was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator"
                        because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To
                        address this risk, in Windows Vista the built-in Administrator account is
                        disabled. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with
                        administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two
                        ways: â€¢ If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account
                        you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator. â€¢ If
                        the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are
                        created. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer
                        and create one if a local administrator account is warranted. Once Windows
                        Vista is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be enabled, but
                        we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.</rationale>

                           <p>The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print
                              sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against
                              session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to
                              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
                              authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is
                              then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB
                              signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs
                              to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server
                              that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server
                              that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and
                              application server performance may be substantially slowed.
                              Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB
                              communications, older applications and operating systems will not be
                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows
                              Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows
                              Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available

                        client/server software that allows users to link personal computers together
                        on a single network. Network capabilities include transparent file and print
                        sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active
                        Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication
                        protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some
                        reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager
                        authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants,
                        and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when
                        they perform the following operations: . Join a domain . Authenticate
                        between Active Directory forests . Authenticate to down-level domains .

                        that the computers negotiate, and the authentication level that servers
                        accept as follows: . Send LM &amp; NTLM responses. Clients use LM and NTLM
                        authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers
                        accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send LM &amp; NTLM use NTLMv2

                        use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers
                        accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLM response only.
                        Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the

                     <rationale xml:lang="en">In Windows Vista, this setting is undefined. However,
                        in Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP clients are configured
                        by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based
                        and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default setting on servers
                        allows all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources.
                        However, this means that LM responses—the weakest form of authentication
                        response—are sent over the network, and it is potentially possible for
                        attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's
                        password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems
                        cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this
                        reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by
                        default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You
                        can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows
                        98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a
                        secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2
                        for earlier clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are
                        members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to
                        authenticate with Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.</rationale>

                           <p>Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea
                              where it is supported. The secure channel protects domain credentials
                              as they are sent to the domain controller. However, only Windows NT
                              4.0 with Service Pack 6a (SP6a) and subsequent versions of the Windows
                              operating system support digital encryption and signing of the secure
                              channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not support it unless
                              they have the Dsclient installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the

                              members of the domain. Potential impacts can include the following: .
                              The ability to create or delete trust relationships with clients
                              running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will
                              be disabled. . Logons from clients running versions of Windows earlier
                              than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled. . The ability to
                              authenticate other domains' users from a domain controller running a
                              version of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a in a trusted

                              member servers, users will not be able to connect to those servers
                              through the network. Successful negotiation of IPsec connections
                              requires that the initiating machine has this right, therefore it is
                              recommended that it is assigned to the Users group. If you have
                              installed optional components such as ASP.NET or Internet Information
                              Services (IIS), you may need to assign this user right to additional
                              accounts that are required by those components. It is important to
                              verify that authorized users are assigned this user right for the
                              computers they need to access the network.</p>

                        computer workstations to a specific domain. For this policy setting to take
                        effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the Default Domain
                        Controller Policy for the domain. A user who has been assigned this right
                        can add up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users who have been assigned
                        the Create Computer Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container
                        in Active Directory can add an unlimited number of computers to the domain,
                        regardless of whether they have been assigned the Add workstations to a
                        domain user right. By default, all users in the Authenticated Users group
                        have the ability to add up to 10 computer accounts to an Active Directory
                        domain. These new computer accounts are created in the Computers container.
                        In Windowsbased networks, the term security principal is defined as a user,
                        group, or computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to
                        control access to resources. In an Active Directory domain, each computer
                        account is a full security principal with the ability to authenticate and
                        access domain resources. However, some organizations may want to limit the
                        number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can
                        consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to
                        add computers to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be
                        hampered. Also, users could perform activities that are more difficult to
                        trace because of their ability to create additional unauthorized domain
                        computers. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited
                        list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active

                        that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for
                        this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to
                        convince a client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or
                        named pipes—to a service that they have created to impersonate that client,
                        which could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or
                        system levels. Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have
                        the built-in Service group added by default to their access tokens. COM
                        servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run
                        under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access
                        tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they
                        are started. Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the
                        following conditions exist: . The access token that is being impersonated is
                        for this user. . The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network
                        with explicit credentials to create the access token. . The requested level
                        is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify. An attacker with
                        the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a
                        service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then
                        impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of
                        the client. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited

                     <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting determines which users can
                        create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects,
                        such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of
                        file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer
                        (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can
                        be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between
                        a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the
                        Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just
                        another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is
                        implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system. Symbolic links can
                        potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not
                        designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic
                        links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only
                        Administrators can create symbolic links. When configuring a user right in
                        the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either
                        local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or
                        computers.</description>

                        could inadvertently or maliciously expose your system to symbolic link

                        file, to corrupt data, to destroy data, or as a denial of service (DoS)

                        access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur
                        when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not
                        synchronized with the domain controllers.</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">Users who can change the time on a computer could
                        cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could
                        be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or
                        modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not
                        be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain
                        from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that
                        the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an
                        administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time
                        may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.
                        The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain controllers,
                        member servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service
                        automatically synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following
                        ways: . All client desktop computers and member servers use the
                        authenticating domain controller as their inbound time partner. . All domain
                        controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain controller (PDC)
                        emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. . All PDC emulator
                        operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their
                        inbound time partner. . The PDC emulator operations master at the root of
                        the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is
                        recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable
                        external time server. This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an
                        attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time
                        service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not
                        accurate.</rationale>

                           are accessed. Only registry objects with SACLs cause audit events to be
                           generated, and only when they are accessed in a manner matching their
                           SACL. By itself, this policy setting will not cause auditing of any
                           events. It determines whether to audit the event of a user who accesses a
                           registry object that has a specified system access control list (SACL),
                           effectively enabling auditing to take place. A SACL is comprised of
                           access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains three pieces of
                           information: . The security principal (user, computer, or group) to be
                           audited. . The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask.
                           . A flag to indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful
                           access events, or both. If you configure the Audit object access setting
                           to Success, an audit entry is generated each time that a user
                           successfully accesses an object with a specified SACL. If you configure
                           this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated each time
                           that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified
                           SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when
                           they configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and
                           Append Data auditing setting on executable files to track when they are
                           changed or replaced, because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
                           typically target executable files. Similarly, you might want to track
                           when sensitive documents are accessed or changed. Events for this

                           include: 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity
                           check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or
                           that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that
                           the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received
                           by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability
                           problems with other IPsec implementations. 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound
                           packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could
                           indicate a replay attack against this computer. 4962: IPsec dropped an
                           inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low
                           a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. 4963: IPsec dropped an
                           inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually
                           due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing
                           this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. 4965: IPsec
                           received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security
                           Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware
                           that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the
                           packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by
                           this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems
                           with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not
                           impeded, then these events can be ignored. 5478: IPsec Services has
                           started successfully. 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down
                           successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at
                           greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential
                           security risks. 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of
                           network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk
                           because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection
                           provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor
                           snap-in to diagnose the problem. 5483: IPsec Services failed to
                           initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started. 5484: IPsec
                           Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The
                           shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of
                           network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5485:
                           IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play

                              connections' to 'Allow (default)'</title>
                           <description xml:lang="en">This setting determines the behavior for
                              outbound connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. The
                              default behavior is to allow connections unless there are firewall
                              rules that block the connection. Important If you set Outbound
                              connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using a
                              GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent
                              Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule
                              that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core
                              Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work.
                              Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test
                              firewall profiles before deploying.</description>
                           <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block
                              all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the
                              user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking
                              outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large
                              number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block
                              applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software.
                              Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an
                              attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall
                              anyway.</rationale>

                              outbound connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. In
                              Windows Vista, the default behavior is to allow connections unless
                              there are firewall rules that block the connection.</description>
                           <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block
                              all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the
                              user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking
                              outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large
                              number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block
                              applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software.
                              Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an
                              attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall
                              anyway.</rationale>

                              outbound connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. The
                              default behavior is to allow connections unless there are firewall
                              rules that block the connection. Important If you set Outbound
                              connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using a
                              GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent
                              Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule
                              that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core
                              Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work.
                              Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test
                              firewall profiles before deploying.</description>
                           <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block
                              all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the
                              user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking
                              outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large
                              number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block
                              applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software.
                              Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an
                              attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall
                              anyway.</rationale>

                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This policy setting determines the
                           number of failed logon attempts before a lock occurs. Authorized users
                           can lock themselves out of an account by mistyping their password or by
                           remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer
                           while logged on to another computer. The computer with the incorrect
                           password will continuously try to authenticate the user, and because the
                           password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock occurs. To avoid
                           accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold
                           to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid
                           logon attempts, which disables the account lockout feature.</p>
                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because it is possible for an
                           attacker to use this lockout state as a denial of service (DoS) by
                           triggering a lockout on a large number of accounts, your organization
                           should determine whether to use this policy setting based on identified
                           threats and the risks you want to mitigate. There are two options to
                           consider for this policy setting.</p>
                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">#x2022; Configure the value for

                           out. This setting value will prevent a DoS attack that attempts to lock
                           out accounts in your organization. It will also reduce help desk calls,
                           because users will not be able to lock themselves out of their accounts
                           accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a brute force
                           attack. The following defenses should also be considered:</p>
                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">#x2022; A password policy that
                           forces all users to have complex passwords made up of 8 or more
                           characters.</p>
                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">#x2022; A robust auditing mechanism,
                           which will alert administrators when a series of account lockouts occurs
                           in the environment. For example, the auditing solution should monitor for
                           security event 539, which is a logon failure. This event identifies that
                           there was a lock on the account at the time of the logon attempt.</p>
                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second option is:</p>
                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">#x2022; Configure the value for
                           Account lockout threshold to a value that provides users with the ability
                           to mistype their password several times, but locks out the account if a
                           brute force password attack occurs. This configuration will prevent
                           accidental account lockouts and reduce help desk calls, but will not
                           prevent a DoS attack.</p>

                           better term than "password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass
                           phrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase
                           such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid pass phrase; it is a
                           considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random
                           numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be

                                 lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your

                                 length requirements, consider teaching your users about pass
                                 phrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger
                                 number of character combinations, much harder to discover.</p>

                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each additional character in a
                           password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a
                           seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267
                           (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000
                           attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities),
                           it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic
                           password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character
                           case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627
                           combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible
                           combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000
                           attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible
                           passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for
                           passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters
                           such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it
                           difficult to mount a brute force attack.</p>

                                 non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to
                                 comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.</p>
                              <p>If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you
                                 can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows
                                 the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For
                                 example, a custom password filter might require the use of
                                 non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that
                                 require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits
                                 between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a
                                 dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not
                                 contain common dictionary words or fragments.</p>
                              <p>Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance
                                 the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password
                                 requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help
                                 desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement
                                 for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the
                                 0128-0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can
                                 represent standard alphanumeric characters that would not add
                                 additional complexity to the password.)</p>

                           on this computer cannot use e-mail or file transfer to ask someone for
                           help. Also, users cannot use instant messaging programs to allow
                           connections to this computer. If you don't configure this policy, users
                           can enable or disable Solicited (Ask for) Remote Assistance themselves in
                           System Properties in Control Panel. Users can also configure Remote
                           Assistance settings. If you enable this policy setting, you have two ways
                           to allow helpers to provide Remote Assistance: "Allow helpers to only
                           view the computer" or "Allow helpers to remotely control the computer."
                           The "Maximum ticket time" setting sets a limit on the amount of time that
                           a Remote Assistance invitation created by using e-mail or file transfer
                           can remain open. The "Select the method for sending e-mail invitations"
                           setting specifies which e-mail standard to use to send Remote Assistance
                           invitations. Depending on your e-mail program, you can use either the
                           Mailto standard (the invitation recipient connects through an Internet
                           link) or the SMAPI (Simple MAPI) standard (the invitation is attached to
                           your e-mail message). This setting is not available in Windows Vista
                           since SMAPI is the only method supported. If you enable this policy you
                           should also enable appropriate firewall exceptions to allow Remote
                           Assistance communications.</p>

                              overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate
                              the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
                              method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence
                              of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the
                              logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because
                              they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any
                              evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you
                              automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all

                     installations. You should note that Automatic Updates will not be able to
                     detect future updates until restarts occur on the affected computers. If you
                     disable or do not configure this setting, Automatic Updates will notify users
                     that their computers will automatically restart in 5 minutes to complete the
                     installations. The possible values for the No auto-restart for scheduled
                     Automatic Updates installations setting are: . Enabled . Disabled . Not
                     Configured Note: This setting applies only when you configure Automatic Updates
                     to perform scheduled update installations. If you configure the Configure
                     Automatic Updates setting to Disabled, this setting has no

                     this update service location to automatically update computers on your network.
                     The Automatic Updates client will search this service for updates that apply to
                     the computers on your network. To use the Specify intranet Microsoft update
                     service location setting, you must set two server name values: the server from
                     which the Automatic Updates client detects and downloads updates, and the
                     server to which updated workstations upload statistics. You can set both values
                     to be the same server. If you enable the Specify intranet Microsoft update
                     service location setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect to the
                     specified intranet Microsoft update service server (instead of Windows Update)
                     to search for and download updates. This configuration allows end users in your
                     organization to avoid firewall issues, and provides you with an opportunity to
                     test updates before you deploy them. If you disable or do not configure this
                     policy setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect directly to the
                     Windows Update site on the Internet (if Automatic Updates is not disabled by

                     when it installs any program on the system. This setting extends elevated

                     that have been assigned to the user (offered on the desktop), assigned to the
                     computer (installed automatically), or made available in Add or Remove Programs
