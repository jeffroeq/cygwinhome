      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   to your end users provided that you do not charge your end users for use of the programs 
   and provided your end users may only use the programs to run your applications for 
   their business operations. Prior to distributing the programs you shall require your 
   end users to execute an agreement binding them to terms consistent with those contained 
   in this section and the sections of this agreement entitled "License Rights," "Ownership 
   and Restrictions," "Export," "Disclaimer of Warranties and Exclusive Remedies," 
   "No Technical Support," "End of Agreement," "Relationship Between the Parties," and 
   "Open Source." You must also include a provision stating that your end users shall 
   have no right to distribute the programs, and a provision specifying us as a third 
   party beneficiary of the agreement. You are responsible for obtaining these agreements 
   with your end users.

   You agree to: 
   (a) defend and indemnify us against all claims and damages caused by your distribution 
       of the programs in breach of this agreements and/or failure to include the required 
       contractual provisions in your end user agreement as stated above; 
   (b) keep executed end user agreements and records of end user information including name, 
       address, date of distribution and identity of programs distributed; 
   (c) allow us to inspect your end user agreements and records upon request; and, 
   (d) enforce the terms of your end user agreements so as to effect a timely cure of any 
       end user breach, and to notify us of any breach of the terms.

   Export 
   You agree that U.S. export control laws and other applicable export and import laws govern 
   your use of the programs, including technical data; additional information can be found on 
   Oracle's Global Trade Compliance web site located at 
   http://www.oracle.com/products/export/index.html?content.html. You agree that neither the 
   programs nor any direct product thereof will be exported, directly, or indirectly, in 
   violation of these laws, or will be used for any purpose prohibited by these laws including, 
   without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation.

   Disclaimer of Warranty and Exclusive Remedies

   THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL 
   WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

   IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR 
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED 
   BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN 
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER SHALL 
   IN NO EVENT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000).

   No Technical Support 
   Our technical support organization will not provide technical support, phone support, or 
   updates to you for the programs licensed under this agreement.

   Restricted Rights 
   If you distribute a license to the United States government, the programs, including 
   documentation, shall be considered commercial computer software and you will place a 
   legend, in addition to applicable copyright notices, on the documentation, and on the 
   media label, substantially similar to the following:

   NOTICE OF RESTRICTED RIGHTS

   "Programs delivered subject to the DOD FAR Supplement are 'commercial computer software' 
   and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be 
   subject to the licensing restrictions set forth in the applicable Oracle license agreement. 
   Otherwise, programs delivered subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations are 'restricted 
   computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including 
   documentation, shall be subject to the restrictions in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer 
   Software-Restricted Rights (June 1987). Oracle America, Inc., 500 Oracle Parkway, 
   Redwood City, CA 94065."

   End of Agreement 
   
   You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs. We have the 
   right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the 
   terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the programs.

   Relationship Between the Parties 
   The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party will 
   represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or 
   implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, 
   employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this agreement shall be 
   construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software 
   that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary 
   information of the other party is not included in such software.

   Open Source 
   "Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, modification and 
   distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's 
   modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with 
   the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source 
   software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: 
   (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or 
   (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under 
        our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, 
        you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source 
        program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both 
        the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation 
        libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires 
        any "modifications" be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle 
        program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any 
        manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle 
        program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.

   Entire Agreement 
   You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses, 
   and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. 
   If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining 
   provisions will remain effective.

                               jTDS LICENSE
     JDBC Driver for Microsoft SQL Server & Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise
   ###########################################################################

   jTDS is Free Software. jTDS is made available under the terms of the GNU Lesser General 
   Public License. The LGPL is sufficiently flexible to allow the use of jTDS in both open 
   source and commercial projects. Using jTDS is considered to be dynamic linking; hence our 
   interpretation of the LGPL is that the use of the unmodified jTDS source or binary does 
   not affect the license of your application code.

   If you modify jTDS and redistribute your modifications, the LGPL applies, basically 
   meaning that you'll have to make the modified version publicly available under the LGPL 
   license too. This ensures that all users of the software have access to all future 
   improvements.

   jTDS was initially based on software released under a BSD license by CDS Networks, Inc. 
   and/or Craig Spannring, the author of the original FreeTDS JDBC driver from which jTDS 
   is derived. Between releases 0.8.1 and 0.9 jTDS was completely rewritten so the original 
   BSD license no longer applies.
